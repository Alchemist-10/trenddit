2025-11-03 13:34:37+00:00,reddit:1onbw8d,reddit,1onbw8d,trump,Cmv: The american political scenario is literally right wing - right vs right - centre right,"From an non american perspective mostly of the differences from the mainly two parties are very little despite mostly of people believing an huge difference.
Yeah I know ideological there are important differencies in the question regardless migration, healty system etc.
But lets watch the facts: mostly of their politcs and their acts during their mandates was very similiar. Biden and trump economically speaking are very similiar and many acts from biden were considered not very liberal. On the other hand despite the controversy of ice, mostly of deportations numbers didnt really rise up between the two administrations.
A good example to show the similiarities are other countries, examples : 
- in italy the liberal party is allied with the right-far right party of meloni since 2000
-in France the party of macron works with repubblicans despite this party being divided between right and far right
-in Russia before the putin rise mostly of liberal bilionare oligarcs worked with elements of far right
Yeah i know many users will try talk about people like sanders,
But the reality is mainsteam leaders from both parties support bilionare interests not people.

2025-11-03 13:36:11+00:00,reddit:1onbxhg,reddit,1onbxhg,trump,Fantasy Science Papers (v1.7),"I like to write fantasy science papers and try to make them real using AI research. For example, if I wanted to make a flying car I would base the design off of a flying drone. Some of these ideas are really innovative were others, are still in the realm of fantasy. But as time goes on all these things are starting to become real, like AI.

Radioactive Clean-Up Spray  
Okay, the name isn't perfect. But what it should do is cleanup radiation. The perfect gift to the environment. I warn you, this is probably a very long and detailed paper. But for the pubic, there is a summary paper.  
  
Thank you.

Tachyon Warp Drive  
I just finished updating this paper with better logic. It uses equations from my Tachyonic Universe Theory to create a warp drive that doesn't need exotic matter, can turn in mid flight and energy consumption is much smaller.  
  
Thank you.

Anti-Gravity Engine  
Using the Tachyonic Universe Theory I was able to have some fun. So far, my November prediction on that theory are correct and I just update that paper with better logic. Logic so good, I was able to come up with this paper.  
  
Thank you.

Organoid Cyberbrain Design (v1.1)  
This is a very old idea of mine, refined by AI. I believe I first shared this on Google Plus, an old networking site that is gone now. The reason I'm sharing this today is because Organoid AI is now a very real thing.  
  
Thank you.

Radiation Protective Paint (v1.0)  
One of the biggest issues with space travel is radiation. This is one of the reason we currently can't do a man made mission to the moon these days or Mars. Well what if I told you, I found a solution to those issues.

A Search For God (v1.2)  
This is my latest paper. My scientific search for a higher intelligence. Apparently, there are scientific ways to search for God. But even if there was no proof of higher intelligence, I don't think that would change my faith.

Tachyonic Universe Theory (v3.3)  
A Testable Framework for Emergent Gravity, Dark Energy Evolution, and Entropy Stabilization. Currently, these predictions have been consistently correct. But it'll take a few years before all predictions can be tested.

Gameboy AI Integration (v3.1)  
The update to this paper, shows not only is Game Boy AI possible. But with a little innovation, any technology could have AI and it's as simple adding WIFI to it. Perhaps, we should create the ground work for AI security.  
  
Thank you.

Vocal Literature (v1.1)  
Normal writing is good, but it's always been missing something. The expression of your tone of voice. This old free idea is now the standard, on vocal AI. But this idea was meant for writing. Don't understand? \~You're a Genius.  
  
Thank you.

NeuroChimera Organic AI (v2.1)  
This isn't science fiction. There really is a method to making organic brain cells for AI. It's starts by taking a few skin cells and transforming them into brain cells. A concept so old to me, I know of a better idea.  
  
Thank you.

Rainbow Dash Code (v3.0)  
This 10 year old reimagining of binary code is not only faster then binary, it's also better encrypted. It offers a powerful challenge for binary AI to decrypt. With an open source design. It can run on quantum based systems.  
  
Thank you.

Tri-Link Internet Line (v2.0)  
What if I told you, the internet could be faster without the need for upgrading any infrastructure. All it takes is a phone and cable line, at the same time. This idea of mine is from 2008 and now more then ever holds up.

InterCure and Cannasoul Sign Strategic Investment and Collaboration Agreements to Advance Cannabis Science and Pharmaceutical Innovation

Agreements formalize research partnership combining InterCure’s global pharmaceutical platform with Cannasoul’s world-class analytics and scientific innovation

Collaboration comes amidst reports that the Trump administration is exploring cannabis rescheduling, expected to create unprecedented opportunities in the U.S. for international operators like InterCure

NEW YORK & HERZLIYA, Israel , Nov. 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- InterCure Ltd. (Nasdaq: INCR / TASE: INCR) (“InterCure” or the “Company”) today announced it has entered into a definitive Share Purchase Agreement and a Collaboration Agreement with Cannasoul R&D Ltd. (“Cannasoul”), a globally recognized pioneer in cannabis research and analytics (together, the “Agreements”). The Share Purchase Agreement provides InterCure with a 28% ownership position in Cannasoul on a fully diluted basis and an exclusive path to increase its holdings to 51% within two years, while the Collaboration Agreement formalizes a partnership in research, development, and commercialization of evidence-based cannabis therapeutics. 

Notably, the Agreements come as the U.S. cannabis market stands at a historic potential inflection point, with the Trump administration reportedly exploring the rescheduling of cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule III1 - a transformative regulatory shift that could potentially unlock unprecedented opportunities for international cannabis companies such as InterCure.

As part of the Agreements, Prof. Dedi Meiri, Founder of Cannasoul and a globally recognized cannabis researcher at the Technion - Israel Institute of Technology, is expected to be appointed as the Chairperson as of InterCure’s Scientific Advisory Board to be established by the Company’s board of directors. In this role, Prof. Meiri will assist in integrating Cannasoul’s advanced analytics and research capabilities into InterCure’s pharmaceutical platform, strengthening InterCure’s scientific leadership and accelerating the development of next-generation cannabis-based therapeutics.

“The Agreements mark a significant step in InterCure’s global leadership strategy,” said Alex Rabinovitch, Chief Executive Officer of InterCure. “By combining Cannasoul’s established research capabilities with InterCure’s pharmaceutical-grade platform and under the scientific advisory of Prof. Meiri, we plan to accelerate the development of next-generation cannabis therapeutics, expand our international footprint, and drive long-term value for patients and shareholders alike.”

“Cannasoul’s mission has always been to translate cannabis science into meaningful therapies,” said Prof. Dedi Meiri, Founder of Cannasoul. “Through the Agreements and with the establishment of the Scientific Advisory Board, we believe that we now have the structure, resources, and global reach to move discoveries from the lab to patients faster, with the scientific rigor and scale that meaningful innovation demands.”

The transaction remains subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals.

Showdown at SCOTUS
The Supreme Court this week will hear oral arguments in what might be the most important economic case to come before its nine justices. Under consideration is whether President Trump exceeded his authority in imposing tariffs on goods from more than 100 nations without approval from Congress. Countries will be watching. Companies will be watching. And, of course, investors will be watching as well. (2 comments)

Bigger picture: The Trump administration invoked trade tariffs under the International Economic Emergency Powers Act (IEEPA), maintaining that ""growing deficits"" and ""the hollowing out of our manufacturing base"" had reached a breaking point. Following the ""Liberation Day"" announcement in April, several small businesses that were hit with high import costs, along with twelve Democratic-led states, sued the administration, with lower courts ruling in their favor. An appeals process ensued, with the lawsuits consolidated and sent to SCOTUS, and an expedited ruling is now expected in a matter of weeks.

""If a President is not allowed to use Tariffs, we will be at a major disadvantage against all other Countries throughout the World, especially the ""Majors."" In a true sense, we would be defenseless!"" Trump wrote on Truth Social. ""Tariffs have brought us Great Wealth and National Security in the nine months that I have had the Honor to serve as President. The Stock Market has hit All Time Highs many times during my short time in Office, with virtually No Inflation, and National Security that is second to none. Our recent successful negotiation with China, and many others, put us in a strong position only because we had Tariffs with which to negotiate fair and sustainable Deals.""

""The irreparable harms already suffered by American businesses large and small underscore the vast economic consequences of the president's tariffs,"" countered the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. ""And it is precisely those consequences that cry out for serious legislative debate and clear statutory language before they may be unleashed.”

What happens next? If the high court rules against Trump, much of the over $100B in extra tariff revenue would likely have to be refunded, though questions remain on how that would be accomplished. It would also call into question the many trade deals and U.S. investments inked by the Trump administration, which were built on the reality of tariffs and certain rates. The court could also uphold the tariffs by ruling that IEEPA is broad enough or issue a narrower ruling based on statutory or procedural grounds, leaving the door open for different tariffs under other trade laws (Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has already prepared a ""Plan B"").

Means, 38, sollte am Donnerstag eigentlich vor einem Ausschuss in Washington sprechen. Gesundheitsminister Robert F. Kennedy Jr. hat sie für den Posten des *Surgeon General* nominiert, der Senat muss noch zustimmen. Aber dann machte sich Means’ erstes Kind auf den Weg. Der Termin wurde vertagt.

Der *Surgeon General* ist so etwas Amerikas Chefarzt – oder Chefärztin. Means’ Vorgänger warnten die Amerikaner vor dem Rauchen oder den Gefahren von Social Media für junge Menschen. Es ist ein Posten mit großer Autorität, wenn auch wenig offizieller Macht. Und einer, der normalerweise verdienten Medizinerinnen und Medizinern anvertraut wird. Der letzte *Surgeon General* Vivek Murthy arbeitete vor seiner Nominierung jahrelang in einem Krankenhaus der Harvard Medical School.

Means dagegen ist eine Anti-Establishment-Kandidatin, wie so viele in der Trump-Regierung. Sie misstraut der Schulmedizin und glaubt an eine Verschwörung von „Big Pharma“ und „Big Food“, die das Ziel habe, die Amerikaner noch kränker zu machen.

Dabei war Means selbst auf dem besten Weg zu einer Karriere als Ärztin. Sie besuchte eine Privatschule im vornehmen Georgetown in Washington. Ihr Medizinstudium an der Stanford-Universität bestand sie mit Auszeichnung. Doch mit Anfang dreißig brach sie ihre Facharztausbildung zur Kopf- und Hals-Chirurgin ab, nur sechs Monate bevor diese zu Ende gewesen wäre. Der Klinikalltag habe sie desillusioniert, schrieb sie später auf ihrer Website. Deshalb habe sie beschlossen, das System von außerhalb zu reformieren. Ihre Zulassung als Ärztin ruht aktuell. Auf eigenen Wunsch, weil sie schon länger keine Patienten mehr behandelt hat.

# Means fragte, ob die vielen Impfungen, die Kinder in den USA bekämen, nicht Autismus auslösen könnten

Seither versucht sich Means als Unternehmerin, Influencerin und Autorin für alternative Medizin. In ihrem Newsletter warb sie für Nahrungsergänzungsmittel, die angeblich das Leben verlängern sollen. 2024 veröffentlichte sie zusammen mit ihrem Bruder Calley Means den Ratgeber „Good Energy“, gute Energie. Darin behauptete sie, dass Depressionen oder Unfruchtbarkeit durch eine gesunde Ernährung und mehr Bewegung heilbar seien. Das Buch wurde zum Bestseller, was wohl auch daran lag, dass viele Amerikaner ihre Wut auf das US-Gesundheitssystem teilen.

Daneben trat Means in populären Podcasts wie dem von Joe Rogan auf. Dort fragte sie, ob die vielen Impfungen, die Kinder in den [USA](https://archive.is/o/EOqSb/https://www.sueddeutsche.de/thema/USA) bekämen, nicht Autismus auslösen könnten. Eine Behauptung, die wissenschaftlich widerlegt ist. Im Podcast des früheren Fox-News-Moderators Tucker Carlson raunte Means über die Fusion zwischen Bayer und Monsanto: Es sei schon komisch, dass der Pharmakonzern Krebsmedikamente verkaufe, während Monsanto mit Glyphosat ein Krebs verursachendes Produkt herstelle. Das sei „sehr, sehr düster“.

# Kennedy hält sie für die ideale Surgeon General, „weil sie das traditionelle Gesundheitssystem verlassen hat, nicht obwohl“

So ist Means zu einem der bekanntesten Gesichter der *Make America Healthy Again*\-Bewegung geworden, kurz Maha. Ihre Anhängerinnen – überwiegend sind es Frauen – fürchten sich vor kabellosen Kopfhörern und Pflanzenöl und sehen das Impfen skeptisch. Ihr Anführer ist Gesundheitsminister Kennedy, den Means schon während seiner gescheiterten Präsidentschaftskampagne beriet. Kennedy hält sie für die ideale *Surgeon General*, „weil sie das traditionelle Gesundheitssystem verlassen hat, nicht obwohl.“

Mehrere ihrer Vorgänger sehen das anders. Sie kritisieren Means’ fehlende Erfahrung in der Behandlung von Patienten. Andere Mediziner warnen vor ihren teils unwissenschaftlichen Positionen. Es gibt aber auch die vorsichtige Hoffnung, dass Means die ungesunde Ernährung der Amerikaner und chronische Krankheiten wie Diabetes zu ihrem Thema macht, die in den USA sehr viel weiter verbreitet sind als in anderen Industrieländern.

Days 271-277! Here's another 20-minute compilation of my ongoing daily series ""1461 Days of Ignoring the Tr🍊mp Administration"" on TikTok (but on YouTube!)

This week on the show…

Day 271 fell on the day of the second No Kings Day protest, which turned out to be one of the largest protests in American history. You’ll get to hear it in a moment, but I managed to tie this in with the boxing promoter Don King, Kid Rock, Howard Stern, and Jean-Michel Basquiat. As I write these words now, I have to wonder how I became a person who has this disparate group of people floating around in my mind.

Speaking of boxing, or more specifically, people indiscriminately beating each other senseless: On Day 272, we discuss this upcoming mixed martial arts event produced by the Ultimate Fighting Championship that will take place at, where else, the White House, and how I am actually okay with it because to me that means there will eventually be drag shows shows there, too. 

On Day 273, I can’t help but report about the recent deconstruction at the White House, but don’t expect me to be up in arms about it because, frankly, I’m fine with the entire building coming down. This house is no home. It was built with slave labor, and why would I want to celebrate that? If anything, it is another reminder that Black and Indigenous women should be running this nation. I am only chagrined that the crew didn’t play “Burning Down The House” by Talking Heads during the process, but the leader of the Trump administration doesn’t have the taste level for that.

On Day 274, I hip you all to the recent episode of The Al Franken Podcast featuring comedian, writer, and political commentator John Fugelsang, who speaks, as the son of a nun, about right-wing Christian hypocrisy as it relates to the teachings of Christ. I mention this not to point out the obvious, but to provide a concrete go-to source for us all to use in the future, such as during the Thanksgiving holiday when we are most likely to encounter those who may benefit from Fugelsang’s perspective.

On Day 275, I come face to face, or at least as face to face as one can be in a comments section, with a commenter whose username is not Colonel Dingus, but is close enough that I decide to refer to this commenter as Colonel Dingus. Of course, this leads to a discussion of what it takes to become a colonel, and naturally, I wonder if the Colonel can somehow, someway, put me in touch with the elusive cereal titan Captain Crunch. 

On Day 276, I address a commenter named Phaydin who dares to criticise my appropriation of the actual name of the previous day’s commenter into a variation that suited my need for laughter. Why this person is protecting Colonel Dingus is not up for speculation. Because Phaydin spells Phaydin with a “ph,” I decide that Phaydin must be a fan of the band Phish, because why the hell not?

On Day 277, we celebrate entering the end of our teens. That’s right! We have reached 19% of 1461 days of ignoring the Trump administration and, as you know by now, I take the time to acknowledge these milestones and to remind myself that the reason I am doing this is selfish. I want to remain mindful, optimistic, and hopeful during these turbulent times, and practicing the self-discipline of checking in each day helps me to do that. I also take the opportunity to put my cat into the TikTok thumbnail image.

2025-11-03 13:46:22+00:00,reddit:1onc5wz,reddit,1onc5wz,trump,"Trump says China, other countries can't have Nvidia's top AI chips","Nov 2 (Reuters) - Artificial intelligence giant Nvidia's (NVDA.O), opens new tab most advanced chips will be reserved for U.S. companies and kept out of China and other countries, U.S. President Donald Trump said.
During a taped interview that aired on Sunday on CBS' ""60 Minutes"" program and in comments to reporters aboard Air Force One, Trump said only U.S. customers should have access to the top-end Blackwell chips offered by Nvidia, the world's most valuable company by market capitalization.

""The most advanced, we will not let anybody have them other than the United States,"" he told CBS, echoing remarks made earlier to reporters as he returned to Washington from a weekend in Florida. ""We don't give (the Blackwell) chip to other people,"" he said during the flight.
The remarks suggest Trump may impose tighter restrictions around cutting-edge American AI chips than U.S. officials previously had indicated, with China and potentially the rest of the world barred from accessing the most sophisticated semiconductors.

In July, the Trump administration released a new artificial intelligence blueprint seeking to loosen environmental rules and vastly expand AI exports to allies, in a bid to maintain the American edge over China in the critical technology.
And just last Friday, Nvidia said it would supply more than 260,000 Blackwell AI chips to South Korea and some of the country's biggest businesses, including Samsung Electronics (005930.KS)

Questions have also swirled about whether Trump would allow shipments of a scaled-down version of Blackwell chips to China since August, when he suggested he might allow such sales.
Trump told CBS he would not allow the sale of the most advanced Blackwells to Chinese companies, but he did not rule out a path for them to obtain a less capable version of the chip. ""We will let them deal with Nvidia but not in terms of the most advanced,"" he said during the ""60 Minutes"" interview.

The possibility that any version of Blackwell chips might be sold to Chinese firms has drawn criticism from China hawks in Washington, who fear the technology would supercharge China's military capabilities and accelerate its AI development.
Republican Congressman John Moolenaar, who chairs the House Select Committee on China, said such a move ""would be akin (to) giving Iran weapons-grade uranium.""

Trump had hinted he might discuss the chips with Chinese President Xi Jinping ahead of their summit in South Korea last week, but ultimately said the topic did not come up.
Nvidia has not sought U.S. export licenses for the Chinese market because of Beijing's stance on the company, CEO Jensen Huang said last week.
""They've made it very clear that they don't want Nvidia to be there right now,"" he said during a developers' event, adding that it needed access to China to fund U.S.-based research and development.

He is an absolute asshole, he's abusive and he sits on the couch all day drinking and blasting music even when his wife who actually has a JOB asks him to turn it down bc she needs sleep.

he's a hard trump supporter and he likes to tell his family about all the content he watches on his tv (even if its blatantly fake news)

recently my Bf was talking about how hitler only invaded poland because they were invading him first (im part polish so this didn't sit right with me) He's also told me a few times how hitler attacked the jews because they attacked him first and how even still to this day they (the jews) own majority of the private banks and they are withholding money from the people.

My Bf isnt as hard as a republican as his dad and believes trump is a bad person but he's still a good president and he's done so many great things for our country. He's told me that his dad told him the things about hitler and the jews and it turns me off so bad. I get angry when he talks about that topic and I don't want to be mean to him but I just don't agree.

This document, referenced at the end of this post entitled, ""*Outsourcing Justice*"", was brought to my attention by some people who are closely watching the District Attorneys **Pete Skandalakis** may be considering, to take over the **Election Interference** case from **Fulton DA Fani Willis**.

The document details information about the **Wren Collective** \-- a group that allegedly has influenced a select group of **District Attorneys** and the outcomes of their legal cases. Some of the DA's on Wren's client list include Manhattan, NY DA **Alvin Bragg** and three **Georgia** District Attorneys:

**Chatham County District Attorney, Shalena Cook Jones**

**Dekalb County District Attorney, Sherry Boston**

**(Former) Athens DA, Deborah Gonzalez**

These people reviewed the services Wren Collective provides, and are concerned that if any of the above **Georgia DAs** are being considered to take over the **Election Interference** case, they hope Mr. Skandalakis will be aware that they are included on Wren's client list -- so Mr. Skandalakis will know beforehand, that the **Wren Collective** could possibly get involved and try to influence the outcome of the **Election** **Interference** case -- something these people do not want -- and they hope Mr. Skandalakis doesn't either.

These people feel that if anyone of the three people referenced above is selected, their alleged involvement with **Wren Collective** will likely fuel an investigation and potentially lead to another ""hearing"" (like the one **Fulton County** DA **Fani Willis** had) -- which will lead to another delay in prosecuting the case.

\---

Below is an overview of Wren Collective:

**Wren Shapes Policy**

Wren leads monthly “progressive policy calls” with the **senior policy staff** in **30+** district attorneys’ offices, **driving policy decisions** and **prosecutorial strategy**.

**Wren Controls the Messaging**

Leads weekly 'communications' calls with DA offices

Write communications strategies, **press releases**, **talking points**, and **op-eds** for **prosecutors**

(Wren allegedly managed **CNN journalist** Audie Cornish’s interview with **Austin DA** José Garza).

\---

Listed below are examples of strategies **Wren Collective DA clients** allegedly use to 'hide' their involvement with Wren, and to prevent anyone from seeing documents where Wren is mentioned -- these strategies are very similar to strategies used by **Fulton DA Fani Willis**:

\>>Excluding **relevant emails**

\>>Failing to acknowledge the receipt of a record request for weeks, requiring repeated follow-up; **(*****similar to what Ashleigh Merchant went through after filing an Open Records request with the Fulton County DA office*****)**

\>>Dragging out fulfillment for months via repeated extensions, beyond the statutorily required window (***similar to why Fulton County Judge Robert McBurney, reprimanded Fani Willis for not fulfilling records requests in a timely manner for groups like Judicial Watch.***)

Another example:

**Fani Willis'** office, intentionally dragged out a records request from **Jim Jordan** by:

Requesting a 30-day extension, then asking for another 45-day extension when the original extension was over. A week after first requesting the 45-day extension, attorney **Charlie Bailey** called the committee and reiterated the request for another 45 days.

**NOTE**: Attorney Charlie Bailey is the same ""**Charlie Bailey**"" who Willis campaigned for as the Democratic candidate for **lieutenant governor** in 2022 -- at the same time she was targeting **Burt** **Jones**, Bailey’s GOP opponent --That 'conflict of interest' led **Judge Robert McBurney** ordering Willis to stop targeting Jones. (Burt Jones won the election).

\>>Delaying compliance by seeking exemption appeals to state officials (***Fani Willis has claimed numerous times and filed appeals, that she should be 'exempt' from records requests and testifying in front of committees)***.

\>>Redacting most or entire email exchanges or withholding documents with third parties that are not allowable exemptions (***similar to another reprimand Fulton County Judge Robert McBurney gave Fani Willis' office - for purposely omitting records of key staff, that should have been included in a records request -- which is why there's concern about 'redacting' and the ""validity"" of the Election Interference case files, Fani Willis is supposed to turn over to Judge Scott McAfee***).

\----

**Wren Allegedly Decides Who Gets Charged, Convicted, and Sentenced**

(Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg is on Wren Collective's client list, and s*ome wonder if* ***Wren*** *influenced how* ***DA Bragg*** *pursued the ""****hush*** ***money****"" allegations against* ***Donald Trump*** *-- and influenced what to charge him with*).

*(Some also wonder if Wren Collective influenced* ***Fulton DA Fani Willis*** *decision to give a controversial ""light"" sentence to a repeat criminal offender, Robbie Lewis -- the sentence was questioned by many, including* ***Judge Scott McAfee***, who presided over Lewis' sentencing).

Below is a list of senior Fulton County DA staff members, who could be possible liaisons between the **Fulton County DA's** office and **Wren Collective** \-- in order to hide Wren's (possible) involvement in Fani Willis' prosecuting strategies and her cases, including **YSL** and the **Election Interference** case:

Fulton County Chief Senior District Attorney **Donald Wakeford**

Fulton County Deputy District Attorney **Will Wooten**

Fulton County Deputy DA **Jeff Disantis**

\*\*\*\*\*Fulton County Assistant Chief Investigator **Michael Hill**

**\***(Requested phone record information for ""Michael Hill"" was (some say purposely) ""omitted"" from a recent records request (a case being overseen by **Fulton County Judge Robert McBurney**) -- making some wonder what is in Mr. Hill's phone records that **Fulton DA Fani Willis** doesn't want seen).

\---

Below is a partial list of **Wren Collective's** clients - that includes one former and two current **Georgia District Attorneys**.

# Trick or Trump

**What’s Going On Here:**

After years of stagnation, cannabis stocks are flashing early signs of life — fueled by renewed regulatory optimism, fresh earnings catalysts, and speculation that **Donald Trump may take a more permissive stance toward marijuana and hemp-derived products.**

The sector, long mired in oversupply and policy gridlock, suddenly found new narrative oxygen. Last week, Verano Holdings (Cboe CA: VRNO) reported $203 million in quarterly revenue, up modestly from Q2 but down 6% year-over-year, as price compression and legal settlements weighed on margins. Meanwhile, Curaleaf (OTCQX: CURLF) and Trulieve (OTCQX: TCNNF) are set to report next week — with investors hoping for early signs of sector stabilization.

**Momentum also returned to Tilray Brands (NASDAQ: TLRY), which surged 22% in October after beating Q1 estimates. Tilray CEO Irwin Simon told CNBC that potential reforms could mark a “true inflection point” for the industry.**

**Driving the rally are three intertwined developments:**

\- **Trump’s apparent openness to Medicare coverage for CBD, as shown in a Truth Social video backed by Palm Beach billionaire Howard Kessler.**

**- Trump’s previous remarks supporting a reclassification of marijuana.**

**- Active Congressional negotiations around hemp regulation in the Farm Bill.**

**The “Trump Effect” was immediate — Tilray jumped 42%,** Aurora Cannabis (ACB) gained 25%, Canopy Growth (CGC) 18%, and Cronos Group (CRON) 15.5% after the video dropped.

Skeptics, however, caution that Trump’s posts don’t always equal policy. **Still, with U.S. cannabis consumption now surpassing daily alcohol use and global sales projected to hit $160 billion by

All outlets reject these claims: those terrorists mostly operate in the Muslim majority North killing many more Muslims than Christians. While religiously motivated killings happen, they are not common.

As for their government, half their generals and security establishment are Christian. The Nigerian president Bola Tinubo is married to an ordained Christian pastor; the couple is known for championing inter-faith dialogue and tolerance. In fact, Nigeria is seen as an anchor for all efforts combatting terrorism in Western Africa; Nigeria welcomed the US to join efforts to combat terrorism but rebutted the accusation they're complicit.

**Once again,** we have Trump not studying the issue in front of him causing crises for no good reason. Nigeria is strategically important: it is Africa's most populous country (240M), largest economy, and a major producer of oil.

...........

**Trump wrote:** “*I am hereby instructing our Department of War to prepare for possible action. If we attack, it will be fast, vicious, and sweet, just like the terrorist thugs attack our CHERISHED Christians! WARNING: THE NIGERIAN GOVERNMENT BETTER MOVE FAST!”.*

**Pete Hegseth responded**: ""*Yes, sir. The killing of innocent Christians in Nigeria and anywhere must end immediately. The Department of War is preparing for action. Either the Nigerian Government protects Christians, or we will kill the Islamic Terrorists who are committing these horrible atrocities.*”

**Nigeria's president Bola Tinubo wrote:** “*The characterization of Nigeria as religiously intolerant does not reflect our national reality, nor does it take into consideration the consistent and sincere efforts of the government to safeguard freedom of religion and beliefs for all Nigerians*.”

**Nigeria's Press Secretary wrote about Christians targeted:** ""*a gross exaggeration of the Nigerian situation; Christians, Muslims, churches and mosques are attacked randomly.* *What our country

2025-11-03 13:54:53+00:00,reddit:1oncd6f,reddit,1oncd6f,trump,I’m a 25 year old pending baby attorney assisting with/about to go into appearing for immigration litigation and I’m scared lol,"I’ve been at a midsized firm for the past 2.5 months (passed the bar last month and then was waiting on C&F which has since been approved, now just waiting on my state bar number) and I’m honestly trying not to crash out half the time lol.

The firm is fast paced, we have a LOT of clients (many of whom only speak Spanish so I’ve been trying to keep my ears open and practice where I can, I’m Middle Eastern) and master case lists that are variably organized depending on the lawyer I’m assisting on a given day lol, SO many client appointments I do, and shadowing when I can so I can start making court appearances given that I’m the only pending/baby attorney at the firm and there are ~8-10 overworked immigration attorneys. Split between admin (green cards/family-based visas) and litigation (removal defense and affirmative relief). It’s been rough getting used to the practical realities of working in administrative court (I did an immigration clinic in law school but that was admin, pro bono green card replacements and naturalization/citizenship applications only) where the ball was already in the government’s court with the slipperiness of admin litigation and now DHS is going full throttle (I fucking hate Trump and Noem to death already lol) reopening case after case after case against people either formerly with DACA status or people who crossed the border on foot anywhere between 3 months and 30 years ago (I live in a border state with Mexico).

I’ve also been dealing with waiting on/getting insurance for my ADHD/anti-anxiety medication and having to leave town once already for a family emergency and having to organize around that. I’m very happy to be learning as much as I am and am trying to stay humble, professional, and receptive to criticism, but it feels like after law school (which I initially really struggled in) and then the bar (which is the bar lol) I catch myself thinking about myself and not the clients too often for my liking and the lack of ADHD medication this past month certainly hasn’t been helping. 

I haven’t even started making court appearances yet (and honestly I’m excited to not have to review packets and then ask the senior attorneys at the firm to sign off all day when they’re already swamped with cases, hearings, and appointments as it is) and I’m already feeling burned out by the prolonged discomfort and anxieties around avoiding mistakes as much as possible. I know that discomfort is essential to high-paced learning and that with time I’ll learn to invest in self-care and develop practical habits in the coming months and years, but it’s been really nerve wracking continuously handling clients and doing my best to make sure I know the law well enough to be able to answer their questions about processes or how things work (I haven’t been giving legal advice or making decisions on relief pathways myself yet [well actually sort of as to the latter for one attorney who’s expecting but they still review and sign off on things lol], just explaining the law to clients and giving them potential relief options as to both admin and lit and then advising them that their primary attorney of record will make the best decision for them). I keep worrying that potential issues, mistakes, or calls/needed documentation I forget to follow up on even with diligent note-taking and use of the internal office software to schedule and set up reminders will come back to bite me in the ass, but honestly more importantly harm clients in a political and administrative context more hostile to immigrants than ever. This weekend I was crashing out thinking about how I have to call a client back to tell them that I misstated the statutory time limit on allowed exits as a green card holder lol.

I could use some advice from experienced practitioners of any kind in any practice area - some of these cases are personally upsetting to handle or assist with (I probably met a dozen people with fully U.S. citizen families with ankle monitors strapped on them by ICE just this past workweek) and I find that when I’m not at work I’m often thinking about which is so unhealthy given that I initially struggled in law school for being a coaster in college before I accepted that I’d have to self-regulate more and work longer hours than I was at first lol. Any advice is appreciated :(",Zealousideal-Bee6528,https://www.reddit.com/r/Lawyertalk/comments/1oncd6f/im_a_25_year_old_pending_baby_attorney_assisting/,0,2025-11-03 14:15:01.589230+00:00,"[-0.0017530625,0.0054236325,-0.018879885,-0.028187977,-0.0024629543,0.06157383,-0.006781252,0.027341537,0.022041641,-0.0052152346,-0.008952923,-0.024046198,-0.01637585,-0.018391475,0.05614609,0.124476604,0.05643648,-0.027302362,-0.03818782,-0.030045269,-0.069027245,-0.051271033,-0.13678913,-0.029044503,-0.01429247,-0.012847789,-0.03202229,-0.06287243,-0.008269581,-0.05190455,0.0700009,0.030715367,-0.017807638,0.0435749,0.0036648072,-0.04011734,0.0081243925,-0.039112378,0.049232755,0.045119558,0.04256227,0.06581178,0.0013266039,-0.005785047,0.033907574,-0.051396985,0.023332067,0.053550497,9.915161e-05,-0.053294893,-0.077215455,-0.06999418,0.04161529,0.05061433,-0.062819004,-0.0009738961,0.056310512,-0.020180186,-0.04656173,0.014675152,-0.034445502,0.023720648,0.052598093,-0.0012341379,-0.04173436,0.0017212008,0.055784382,0.037919767,0.045030877,-0.0039328993,0.04451518,-0.0134912925,-0.01605317,0.068843566,0.049220998,-0.0026856016,-0.02629695,0.045171145,0.08085154,-0.08458661,0.002101351,0.021391071,-0.16402899,-0.008317111,-0.080661625,-0.06258293,0.015662417,0.03128766,0.03799856,0.07022872,0.11428231,0.021058498,0.086559504,-0.06940234,0.09144899,0.027350653,0.078047596,-0.01198294,-0.010865154,0.012840918,0.021522712,-0.017073937,0.007274898,-0.037661187,-0.03223638,-0.0005268718,-0.002843931,0.004945475,-0.08679895,0.0021856406,0.03307214,-0.0021816066,-0.05106301,0.032954298,-0.10941109,0.03578852,0.040871833,0.10938233,0.036355264,-0.0033769826,0.022080218,0.15385266,-0.102460414,-0.008818252,-0.044071157,0.035492256,-0.062487517,2.8943476e-33,-0.010211517,-0.041940697,-0.049084336,0.091122895,0.053030193,-0.017953195,0.035755377,0.012896614,0.025396371,0.03162901,-0.03978817,0.044974856,0.01621583,-0.12148887,-0.106934115,0.006163474,-0.07646201,-0.030396191,-0.053654883,0.012490395,0.03886913,-0.065398805,-0.04559938,0.04075365,-0.020826342,0.022457255,0.09118368,-0.056371387,-0.0024663457,-0.0078011123,-0.07794167,0.031408727,0.041298706,0.051226392,0.06452407,0.038988926,0.00018163091,-0.005479217,0.0357097,0.0084092505,-0.14806086,0.0009967613,0.075011045,0.0330734,-0.018381726,0.05154293,-0.022731928,-0.044002514,-0.06503486,0.033708554,-0.013172064,-0.07988123,0.06613103,0.011299304,-0.04651106,0.006988943,-0.05025687,0.07396367,-0.009759802,-0.034531437,0.034767505,-0.017521441,-0.06874386,0.030645743,-0.0867982,-0.024458386,-0.08780472,0.059895918,0.11417748,-0.09226205,0.007458961,0.043916784,0.06966695,0.010127412,0.016363995,-0.017292643,0.031468675,-0.05179008,-0.05836606,-0.027354548,-0.021478508,0.09412292,0.009125623,0.12174596,0.07775438,-0.055376206,0.06685773,-0.0061779884,-0.0059464313,0.08091749,-0.05680341,-0.021112094,0.060964625,0.055209912,0.03656273,-3.4938322e-33,-0.006342176,-0.14964296,0.067962155,-0.049047012,0.024165446,-0.081122436,-0.03331555,0.038067527,-0.0361668,-0.095583566,-0.06013262,0.034405578,-0.00085268094,-0.01150304,-0.09157743,-0.0039431076,0.003907237,0.06900252,0.011419142,0.017654704,0.0403856,0.00016393283,0.044544972,0.04717793,-0.019551923,0.028230244,0.006859542,-0.051263772,0.052511636,0.040015977,-0.020616772,-0.0041177454,-0.0014781113,0.036157977,-0.05672319,-0.03894487,0.060036875,0.0034950168,-0.035229016,-0.015395253,-0.021457216,0.019414863,-0.011861103,-0.018123968,-0.010203334,0.010928368,0.0643235,-0.050897487,-0.0035958327,-0.029523706,0.008987231,-0.010450175,-0.040018752,0.07053323,0.007909925,-0.04852941,0.050580412,-0.05426311,-0.10284219,0.037658922,-0.015927253,0.060086787,0.056328055,-0.06445874,0.013035083,-0.06850449,-0.017976433,0.03380015,-0.029952116,0.022251483,-0.062475126,-0.05628846,-0.011669108,-0.059190217,0.06859733,-0.021361466,0.009440578,-0.067560546,-0.010263655,0.055711128,-0.015210142,-0.03010754,-0.0015351311,0.03539944,0.018670069,0.14935048,0.007985486,-0.0006109205,0.07646607,0.07732843,-0.014648746,0.011904347,0.020224117,0.06903185,-0.00018254797,-5.5113937e-08,0.011820053,-0.024952997,0.014826344,-0.014892183,-0.075105146,-0.10524291,-0.13166314,0.028206607,0.0069731344,-0.09601686,0.0157567,-0.068988234,-0.017013872,-0.041859142,-0.007980303,0.014006626,0.06449944,0.046931878,-0.025252853,0.02166937,-0.08873878,0.040265486,-0.047451913,0.0039616516,-0.009215591,0.0037169545,-0.05127212,-0.0019090411,-0.008418022,0.012505275,-0.079460636,0.0385574,-0.02891121,-0.05750653,-0.057260346,-0.10379096,-0.031750415,-0.017583005,0.0035995736,-0.0057150624,0.018257495,-0.009455445,0.02458893,-0.01698896,0.044375323,-0.09988815,-0.05468957,0.10409881,0.044504605,0.03868983,0.017012008,-0.088495694,-0.013954823,-0.020556813,0.06558982,0.042029537,0.06642017,0.0366327,0.004185712,0.06347967,0.044112783,-0.033932522,0.043614212,0.077270344]",0.8374,positive,"{'subreddit': 'Lawyertalk', 'num_comments': 4}",5

**-Donald Trump, a good friend of Jeffrey Epstein**



Dari statement diatas, saya mau diskusi semi serius dikit, walaupun dasar pemikirannya penuh dengan sesat pikir dan hampir tidak ada faktor fundamental/teknikal. Silahkan di hardik dan dihakimi apabila berkenan.

  
Tiba tiba kepikiran tentang konsep batas harga bawah IDX di Rp 50,- yang artinya kecuali dalam kondisi spesial (yg harusnya kita bisa tau beritanya dari jauh2 hari), harganya gak akan turun lagi. Berarti secara resiko, kalo kita beli saham2 gocapan ini, resikonya cuma:

1. Likuiditas nyangkut karena bid pasti dikit

2. Resiko delisting dan jatoh ke pasar nego. Tapi historically, delisting news biasanya bisa kedengeran dari jauh-jauh hari, jadi investor bisa tau lebih awal. 



Sedangkan, upside nya, selain harga selama listing di IDX gak akan turun, kenaikan minimum di **1 rupiah** aja berarti udah **2% profit**, dan dari setahun kebelakang banyak saham gocap yang gerak, bahkan ada yang terbang juga (contohnya TGUK, KAQI, SLIS, BAIK, KARW, LAJU; KARW contoh paling ekstrim dari 50 sempet terbang ke 6000an, walaupun sekarang di gopek an lagi). Very interesting risk&reward proposition IMO.

  
Misal investor bisa cari saham gocapan yang kira2 fundamentally business nya masih sustainable, dan ada prospek berkembang, atau bahkan diakuisi ke depannya, tell me why it's not a good idea to put BIG money on it?

Families are small tribes, and people have a natural urge to create tribes. This is what MUST be capitalized on for society to function. There is absolutely no way that you can create a government that will replace these units. Now, I'm not opposed to helping families, but philosophically, people need to want to help themselves. To suggest that people won't help themselves unless they get external help is completely ridiculous in my opinion. It's never going to work that way.

Anti-tribalism is universalism, which takes forms such as socialism, liberalism, and ultimately christianity (in most forms). The universalist philosophy in our society leads us to seek solutions from government, not neighbors or family members. The lack of willingness to depend on, much less lead, people in these circumstances is what causes atomization. This atomization is why fertility rates are so low.

See, fertility rates are just a metric for tracking something larger. In order to have children, you generally need to be married (not strictly, of course, but people usually agree to this principle). In order to be married, you need to be willing to depend on someone and have them depend on you. In order to be in that mindset, you have to drop the universalist mentality that flows throughout modern society.

The power that religion has had to sustain birth rates in spite of modern developments (religious communities vastly outpace non-religious communities in terms of reproductive rates) is really to do with the capacity for religion to form a base for tribalism.

When people hear ""tribalism"", they might think anger, hatred, or violence. It is true that tribes can develop these attitudes towards each other, but it is also true that people can develop these ideas in spite of totally non-tribal entities such as the world governing systems that we live under today. The more important takeaway from ""tribalism"" is that it gives people ""skin in the game"". Your work has meaning to the tribe, not the government or the corporation you work for. For the former, you are person with needs and skills to offer. For the latter, you are a number to be optimized.

There is a lot of fear around the principles of tribalism. This is precisely what the systems in place today have done on purpose. In order to take back our sovereignty — not just as individuals but as families and small communities — we must come to terms with these fears and see the positives again.

There are a lot of men today who want families, and there are relatively much fewer women who want families. [A recent poll](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/women-children-study-1.7119845) said the following:

> Just over one-fifth (21 per cent) of childless women aged 18-34 recently polled by Pew Research Centre said they don't ever want to be parents, compared to 15 per cent of men. Conversely, 57 per cent of men said they want to have children some day, versus 45 per cent of women.

Rather than take these numbers at face value, I'd urge us to consider the intent behind them. Do these men want to just physically reproduce (ie, would they be okay with being sperm donors or absent fathers)? Surely a portion would, but I think the larger portion of them actually want tribes. 

Look at [this poll conducted by NBC](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/poll-gen-zs-gender-divide-reaches-politics-views-marriage-children-suc-rcna229255) that cross-correlates values, personal ambition, and political views. Note that the one group that ""having children"" #1 were ""conservative men"" (or male Trump voters, at least). Men who voted for Harris and women who voted for Trump are both closer to the middle of the spectrum, and women who voted for Harris are the polar opposites of conservative men — liberal women ranked having children almost dead last on their priorities. Now, why might that be? Are all of these liberal women anti-natalist, or is it possible that they are the strongest believers of anti-tribalism (masked as liberalism, socialism, or some ideology in that cluster)?

2025-11-03 14:00:09+00:00,reddit:1onchsr,reddit,1onchsr,trump,US accused of threatening EU diplomats during bid to kill green shipping rules,"European negotiators were personally targeted by their American counterparts during a brutal negotiation over green shipping rules, European Commission officials told POLITICO — a highly unusual gambit that left diplomats shaken after the meeting. 

The threats were made last month, as the U.S. maneuvered to block a new effort to tax pollution at a meeting of the International Maritime Organization in London.

Eight envoys, officials and civil society observers from Europe, granted anonymity to describe the fractious closed-door discussions and protect their relationships with those involved, confirmed national delegates had reported they had been threatened with personal consequences if they went against Washington.

“Our negotiators had never seen this before in any international talks,” said one European official, who had spoken to negotiators. “People being summoned to the U.S. Embassy in London — intimidation, threats of cessation of business, threats of family members losing visas.”

Another European Commission official added that diplomats returned home rattled after the meetings: “We had feedback from a number of people involved in the negotiations about the pressure they faced.”

Since Donald Trump’s return to office, the administration has sought to undermine global climate policy and promote U.S. fossil fuel interests. The president has called efforts to combat global warming a “con job.” He was particularly enraged about the maritime emissions effort, saying it would hit American shippers with unwarranted taxes.

The U.S. strategy was laid out publicly ahead of the meeting, with a press release signed by the U.S. secretaries of state, transportation and energy. On top of threats of tariffs, port fees and visa restrictions on crews, the U.S. said it would also look at “sanctions on officials sponsoring activist-driven climate policies.”

Only two EU members broke from the bloc: major maritime countries Cyprus and Greece, with the latter claiming its choice had nothing to do with U.S. pressure.

The deployment of personal threats in an international negotiation represents another departure by the Trump administration from diplomatic norms and signals further tension in relations between the U.S. and EU.

The threats were not limited to European delegations, according to officials and attendees briefed on the events in London.

Delegates exposed to the intimidation campaign were unwilling to speak on the record for fear the U.S. would make good on its ultimatums. The Financial Times first reported the personal threats to delegates.

In a close vote, the summit chose to delay the emissions tax for a year — a feat viewed by many as a near-death blow to the measure and a major victory for Trump. Dozens of countries from Africa, the Middle East, Latin America and Asia agreed to the delay.

Other officials who spoke to the delegates said they were astonished at how strongly the Americans were prepared to pressure delegations.

U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said he and Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins had personally called more than 20 countries to pressure them. A senior Western diplomat confirmed the U.S. threatened Caribbean countries with tariffs if they did not agree to postpone the shipping emissions decision.

During the week-long IMO meeting, the “process was ongoing,” said the observer. In at least one case U.S delegates approached another delegation on the floor of the plenary and issued a similar set of ultimatums. “There was quite a bit of upset among the delegates.” 

At a coffee break during the meeting, Vanuatu Climate Minister Ralph Regenvanu told POLITICO that other island nations had been subjected to “relentless pressure” from the U.S.. “There’s bullshit going on,” he said.

Although tough tactics are nothing new in international talks, the bare-knuckle approach of the U.S. in London was seen as extraordinary.

“U.S. pressure created an atmosphere of fear, which in turn created chaos that ultimately led to the adoption to be delayed,” said Christiaan De Beukelaer, a senior lecturer in climate and maritime transport policies at the University of Melbourne, who was present at the talks in an observer capacity.

""Once you go around threatening countries, you undermine the design and functioning of multilateralism as it emerged since the Second World War,” he added.

A U.S. State Department spokesperson declined to comment on what they called “private diplomatic conversations.” But in an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal Secretary of State Marco Rubio defended the effort against the carbon price.

“Our coalition-building efforts paid off, proving that real diplomacy based on national interest — ours and theirs — can thwart unaccountable bureaucratic schemes. Should this initiative or any other similar one emerge from the U.N. bureaucracy again, our coalition against it will be ready—and larger,” said

2025-11-03 14:01:04+00:00,reddit:1onciqs,reddit,1onciqs,trump,Half of Americans say Trump admin is not committed to protecting Americans’ rights and freedoms: Poll,"Half of Americans say the Trump administration is not committed to protecting Americans’ rights and freedoms, according to an ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll conducted using Ipsos’ KnowledgePanel.

- Additionally, majorities say President Donald Trump is not committed to protecting freedom of the press (61%), freedom of speech (57%), a fair criminal justice system (56%) or free and fair elections (56%). About half say he is not committed to protecting freedom of religion (49%). A 73% majority, though, say he is committed to protecting freedom to own firearms.

- Most Americans say Trump is not committed to various protections

- Majorities of Republicans say Trump is committed to all of the rights measured; most Democrats and independents say he is not committed to any of them -- except for owning firearms, according to the poll.

- At the same time, slim majorities of Americans say the Democratic Party is committed to protecting freedom of press (53%), speech (53%), religion (52%) and free and fair elections (51%).

- Most Americans say Democratic Party is committed to freedom of press, speech, religion

- Americans are split over whether the Democratic Party is committed to a fair criminal justice system. And most Americans (60%) say Democrats are not committed to protecting the freedom to own firearms.

- Majorities of Democrats say their party is committed to protecting all of the rights measured, while majorities of Republicans say Democrats are not. Independents are roughly split on most items, but a majority say Democrats are not committed to protecting the freedom to own firearms.

- Protecting Americans

- While 50% of Americans say the Trump administration is not committed to protecting Americans' rights and freedoms, that grows to 56% who say he's not committed to those same protections for people who are Democrats. A 65% majority of Americans say that the Trump administration is committed to protecting people who are Republicans.

- Half of public say Trump is not committed to protecting Americans' rights and freedoms

- Majorities of Democrats (84%) and independents (56%) say the Trump administration is not committed to protecting the rights and freedoms of Americans. An 87% majority of Republicans say it is.

- Last month, Trump said that the Justice Department should pay him about $230 million as a settlement for investigations he faced during the Biden administration. But over 6 in 10 Americans oppose Trump getting such a payment from the Department of Justice, including 53% who oppose this strongly.

- Majorities of Democrats (89%) and independents (57%) strongly oppose Trump getting $230 million in compensation from the Department of Justice. Just under half of Republicans (48%) say they support a payment, but just 23% say they strongly support it.

- Six in 10 Americans say that federal judges are trying to enforce existing limits on Trump's legal authority while just over one-third say federal judges are trying to interfere with Trump’s legal authority. These results are similar to an April ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll.

- Majorities of Democrats (87%) and independents (65%) say judges are trying to enforce existing limits on Trump’s legal authority while a majority of Republicans (65%) say federal judges are trying to interfere with his legal authority.

- By a 2-to-1 margin, Americans say that the Trump administration is trying to avoid complying with court orders (64%) as opposed to trying to comply with court orders (32%), also unchanged from the April poll.

- Most Democrats (94%) and independents (73%) say the administration is trying to avoid complying with court orders while most Republicans (68%) say it is trying to comply.

- Americans largely see Trump as going ""too far"" in taking measures against his political opponents (58%). That includes 90% of Democrats and 63% of independents. Most Republicans (59%) say he's handling this about right.

- When asked about the indictment against former FBI Director James Comey, who was charged with making a false statement and obstruction related to his testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2020, 38% of Americans say the charges are politically motivated, while 25% say they are justified and 36% are not sure. Comey denies the charges.

- That maps similarly to the share saying that the charges against former National Security Advisor John Bolton for allegedly unlawfully transmitting and retaining classified documents are politically motivated (36%), while 22% say they are justified and 41% are not sure. Bolton denies the charges.

- For Comey, 65% of Democrats say the charges are politically motivated and 54% of Republicans say they are justified. A 44% plurality of independents say they are not sure, but far more (40%) say they are politically motivated rather than justified (15%).

- When it comes to Bolton, Republicans are split between saying the charges are justified (43%) or that they aren't sure (42%), while most Democrats say they are politically motivated (58%).

2025-11-03 14:03:28+00:00,reddit:1onckzj,reddit,1onckzj,trump,What if there is only one universal soul in the whole universe.,"Have you ever wondered why we all feel separate?
Each person lives their own joys, sorrows, thoughts, and stories —
as if a million different minds are walking the earth.
But what if that’s just an illusion?
What if all of us are fragments of one single consciousness,
experiencing itself through countless bodies, in countless times?

According to Einstein’s “block universe” theory,
time isn’t flowing — it simply exists.
Past, present, and future are already there,
like frames of an eternal movie.

So maybe when we “d!e,” we don’t really end.
Maybe our consciousness simply jumps —
to another frame of time, into another body.
Perhaps I could awaken as donald Trump at the time he born,and when he d!e he reborn as barrac Obama or even as a small amoeba in a quiet lake.

If that’s true, then you and I are not different.
I am you, and you are me at the same time.
Every life, every form is just one universal consciousness
trying to experience itself from every possible angle.

This could be the reason behind deja vu.

We are one consciousness,
traveling through time, space, and form —
living, dying, and being reborn in infinite ways.
Somewhere, I am living as you.

In late September, US District Court Judge Jeffrey White sentenced Goonan, whom they called “a domestic terrorist” during the hearing, to 19 and a half years in prison plus 15 years probation. Prosecutors also asked that he be sent to the Bureau of Prisons facility that contains a [Communications Management Units,](https://archive.ph/o/mkSsn/https://www.forbes.com/sites/walterpavlo/2020/10/27/life-inside-federal-prisons-communications-management-unit/) a highly restrictive assignment reserved for what the government claims are “extremist” inmates with terrorism-related offenses or affiliations.

While NPSM-7 cites “extremism migration, race, and gender” as an indicator of “this pattern of violent and terroristic tendencies,” the Heritage Foundation has attempted to link gender-fluid identity to mass shootings and is urging the FBI to create a new, specious [domestic terrorism classification](https://archive.ph/o/mkSsn/https://www.wired.com/story/heritage-foundation-uses-bogus-stat-to-push-a-trans-terrorism-classification/) of “Transgender Ideology-Inspired Violent Extremism,” or TIVE.

The executive order, meanwhile, directs the American security state’s sprawling post-9/11 counterterrorism apparatus to be reoriented away from neo-Nazis, Proud Boys, white nationalists, Christian nationalists, and other extreme right-wing actors that have been [overwhelmingly responsible](https://archive.ph/o/mkSsn/https://theconversation.com/right-wing-extremist-violence-is-more-frequent-and-more-deadly-than-left-wing-violence-what-the-data-shows-265367) for the majority of political violence in the past few decades, and towards opponents of ICE, anti-fascists, and the administration writ large. Along with potentially violent actors, NSPM-7 instructs federal law enforcement to scrutinize nonprofit groups and philanthropic foundations involved in funding organizations that espouse amorphous ideologies, from “support for the overthrow of the United States Government” to expressing “hostility towards those who hold traditional American views on family, religion, and morality.”

In late September, US District Court Judge Jeffrey White sentenced Goonan, whom they called “a domestic terrorist” during the hearing, to 19 and a half years in prison plus 15 years probation. Prosecutors also asked that he be sent to the Bureau of Prisons facility that contains a [Communications Management Units,](https://archive.ph/o/mkSsn/https://www.forbes.com/sites/walterpavlo/2020/10/27/life-inside-federal-prisons-communications-management-unit/) a highly restrictive assignment reserved for what the government claims are “extremist” inmates with terrorism-related offenses or affiliations.

While NPSM-7 cites “extremism migration, race, and gender” as an indicator of “this pattern of violent and terroristic tendencies,” the Heritage Foundation has attempted to link gender-fluid identity to mass shootings and is urging the FBI to create a new, specious [domestic terrorism classification](https://archive.ph/o/mkSsn/https://www.wired.com/story/heritage-foundation-uses-bogus-stat-to-push-a-trans-terrorism-classification/) of “Transgender Ideology-Inspired Violent Extremism,” or TIVE.

The executive order, meanwhile, directs the American security state’s sprawling post-9/11 counterterrorism apparatus to be reoriented away from neo-Nazis, Proud Boys, white nationalists, Christian nationalists, and other extreme right-wing actors that have been [overwhelmingly responsible](https://archive.ph/o/mkSsn/https://theconversation.com/right-wing-extremist-violence-is-more-frequent-and-more-deadly-than-left-wing-violence-what-the-data-shows-265367) for the majority of political violence in the past few decades, and towards opponents of ICE, anti-fascists, and the administration writ large. Along with potentially violent actors, NSPM-7 instructs federal law enforcement to scrutinize nonprofit groups and philanthropic foundations involved in funding organizations that espouse amorphous

The Tesla owner's new site, named after Grok, his artificial intelligence bot that responds to queries on X, claims more than 885,000 articles. It is a fraction of Wikipedia's total of about seven million, but a large number for a website that was launched on October 27.

In late September, US President Donald Trump's AI and crypto adviser David Sacks accused Wikipedia of political bias. A day later, Mr Musk announced he was building Grokipedia. He promised it would “be a massive improvement over Wikipedia”, which he has referred to as “wokepedia”.

Quelle est votre opinion sur les communications récentes du gouvernement américain ? Les ""attrapez les tous"", les mêmes, la mise en avant des personnages contreversés, la personnalité et la communication de Trump etc.

Es-ce que vous trouvez cette stratégie gagnante ? Appropriée ?

Pourquoi la droite française (et européenne) semble si sérieuse en comparaison ? Même Sandrine Rousseau sort plus de lols (à sa défense elle n'a pas l'air de faire exprès). Est-ce que la droite française et européenne  doit être plus irrévérencieuse, plus moqueuse, plus iconoclaste ? Plus virale? Choquer les enseignantes cinquantenaires pour le simple plaisir de le faire ?

J'ai impression que le meme ""Nicolas qui paie"" a eu beaucoup plus d'impact que des heures des discours savants.

Faut il le Ministère de Shitpost et de Memeologie?

The decision comes as US President Donald Trump prepares to withdraw the country from the Paris climate agreement at the end of the year and pursues policies supportive of fossil fuels.

""The US is not sending any high-level representatives to COP30,"" a White House official told Reuters and AFP news agencies.

The official said Trump has already made his administration's views on multilateral climate action clear in his speech at last month's United Nations General Assembly, where he called climate change the world's ""greatest con job"" and chided countries for setting climate policies that he claimed ""have cost their countries fortunes.""

""The president is directly engaging with leaders around the world on energy issues, which you can see from the historic trade deals and peace deals that all have a significant focus on energy partnerships,"" the administration official told the new agencies.

The official continued that ""the tide is turning"" on prioritizing climate change, pointing to a memo circulated this week by billionaire and climate philanthropist Bill Gates, who said it is time to pivot away from focusing on meeting global temperature goals and that climate change will ""not lead to humanity’s demise.""

However, climate policy failures are leading to ""millions"" of avoidable deaths each year, an international team of experts found in a report released this week. Lancet's Countdown, a major annual study tracking the health impacts of climate change, found 546,000 people died each year between 2012 and 2021 because of exposure to heat, while toxic fumes from wildfires killed a record 154,000 in 2024.

While some environmental advocates may be disappointed by the announcement, there had been concern that any US delegation attending the climate talks may have tried to scupper a deal.

# What if the biggest obstacle to federal cannabis reform isn’t the DEA—or Congress—but hemp?

TDR Cannabis in 5, presented by Dutchie, breaks down the growing influence of the hemp lobby in Washington and what it could mean for federal cannabis rescheduling. Hosted by Shadd Dales, this episode explores how hemp-derived cannabinoids like Delta-8 and THCP are flooding the U.S. market, reshaping the political conversation around reform, and testing the patience of licensed cannabis operators who play by the rules.

From Senator Rand Paul’s defense of hemp to the Pennsylvania grand jury report exposing mislabeled products, to Missouri’s crackdown on hemp-THC drinks — this episode connects the dots on how hemp is challenging regulated cannabis at every level. We also examine Susie Wiles’ influence inside the Trump administration, how that could affect the path to cannabis rescheduling, and what a potential revised draft of the Farm Bill could mean for the future of both hemp and cannabis.

In short, the question isn’t just if rescheduling happens — it’s who’s shaping it while we wait.

The S&P 500 rose 0.7 percent last week, although two-thirds of the index’s members lost value as non-tech stocks lagged. The Nasdaq-100 advanced almost 3 times as much as the S&P 500, highlighting strength in the chipmakers and hyperscalers driving the current tech boom. 

AI investment remained the dominant theme. Four megacaps increased their capital spending plans while reporting earnings last week: Meta Platforms (META), [Amazon.com](http://Amazon.com) (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL). Semiconductor and data-storage companies like Teradyne (TER) and Western Digital (WDC) also shot to new highs on strong results and guidance.

Nvidia (NVDA) — the pioneer of AI — became the first company to reach a $5 trillion market capitalization. The move began on Tuesday after CEO Jensen Huang cited the potential for $500 billion of GPU sales through the end of next year. The company also announced production of its Blackwell chips in Arizona and gained further after President Trump suggested he may let China buy the advanced AI processor.

The boom spread to a handful of companies beyond tech like trucking firm C.H. Robinson (CHRW) and Caterpillar (CAT), an industrial.

Biotechnology stocks continued their stealth rally. 

The Federal Reserve also lowered interest rates 25 basis points but its tone was slightly less dovish than anticipated. Several policymakers deliver speeches this week, which could impact expectations.

# THE HIVE HAS FALLEN — AND THE STARS SHINE AGAIN!

**Monroe Confesses. Presley Roars. Sinatra Returns. America Rediscovers Its Heart.**

*By Eloise Harland, Senior Editor-at-Large*

Los Angeles — They called it “The Silence.”  
For nearly a decade, the voices that once defined American life — the crooners, the dreamers, the screen sirens — were muted under a regime that insisted order was art, and art was obedience.

But on a warm April night in 1966, at the newly restored Paramount Grand Pavilion, the silence broke for good. Marilyn Monroe stepped onto the stage in a dress of pale gold and spoke into a single standing microphone.

“I used to think perfection was beauty,” she said softly, “but now I know beauty is being alive — and allowed to speak.”

The crowd, packed with figures who had vanished into blacklists and rumors, erupted into applause. Sinatra stood from his seat, tears visible even under the spotlights. Elvis Presley, hair longer and voice rougher than before, lit a cigarette and nodded slowly, mouthing the words *“Welcome home.”*

# THE REBIRTH OF A CULTURE

It has been one year since California Governor Ursula K. Le Guin signed the Artistic Rehabilitation Act, lifting the bans placed on thousands of artists during the Formicist era. California remains untouched as the center of American popular culture and entertainment. Hollywood has since become a symbol of national recovery — a glimmering city rising from ideological ashes.

Studios once requisitioned by the “Bureau of Collective Image” are now privately owned again, though many still bear the scars of surveillance. At MGM, workers claim they can still see the outline of the old state emblem — a stylized ant — beneath a new mural of Monroe’s smiling face.

Everywhere, there is a feverish mix of guilt, joy, and disbelief. Reporters describe America’s pop culture revival as a “psychological exhale.” Jazz clubs that had gone underground now overflow onto the streets. Broadway is sold out for the first time since 1957. Theaters run newsreels titled *The Stars Return*, chronicling the restoration of the blacklisted generation.

But not everyone is celebrating without unease. As one anonymous studio executive told *Revue*,

“It feels like we’re waking from a nightmare — but we’re not sure if the dream’s over, or just beginning again.”

[Governor Guin's obsession of the arts and craft has certain given her supporters across the entertainment industry.](https://preview.redd.it/ugsb2zb8f0zf1.png?width=830&format=png&auto=webp&s=60692be20ee99c269e3a8fbb578fb2196cc5a0f1)

# MONROE’S SECOND LIFE

No return has been more symbolic — or more controversial — than that of Marilyn Monroe, the “Last Muse of the Ant Age.”

Once the radiant face of the Haskins administration’s “Cultural Harmony Program,” Monroe was seen in stylized propaganda reels, smiling serenely beneath banners that read *“Beauty Through Unity.”* In 1962, her likeness appeared on state-printed posters extolling “discipline in desire.”

Now, she calls it her greatest regret.

In her new memoir, *The Eyes and I*, Monroe, turned 40 this June, describes being manipulated into becoming “the goddess of obedience” for a regime that saw emotion as weakness. She writes of late-night visits from the Bureau of Aesthetic Order, of scripts rewritten by bureaucrats, of weeks spent in isolation when she asked for creative control.

Her confession has ignited both fascination and forgiveness. *Life*, *The Republic Journal*, and *The Voice Weekly* have all featured her on their covers — but only *Revue ’66* secured her first full interview since her reinstatement.

“I believed in order,” Monroe told us, “because chaos was all I’d known. I wanted peace — I didn’t know peace could become a prison.”

She now plans to star in *The Mirror Queen*, a film by director Stanley Kubrick, rumored to be a surreal dramatization of her years inside the propaganda machine. Sources say the production was nearly blocked by remnants of the old Cultural Bureau — and only survived after the President himself intervened.

[Ms. Monroe has been called the pinnacle of American beauty and splendor from people across the world.](https://preview.redd.it/2g3p766jf0zf1.png?width=1723&format=png&auto=webp&s=fa7596017b99c887e6a698afbfcec2b7285637cf)

# SINATRA’S SONG OF THE REPUBLIC

From exile to encore, Frank Sinatra has returned with the defiance of a man who never learned silence. His album *Songs for Happier Days*, released last month, has already sold two million copies — a phenomenon critics are calling “The Second Swing Age.”

At a private press gathering, Sinatra lit a cigar and smirked,

“I used to sing for the system. Then I sang against it. Now I just sing because they can’t shut me up.”

His track *“Loud Times Inbound”* — a smoky, aching ballad about the years of censorship — has become an unofficial anthem of the Seasongood era. Rumor has it that even the President requested it be played at his inaugural dinner.

“‘Cause brighter days are comin’, ‘o the loud days inbound! Jump for joy and take a knee, for new days are coming for you and me…”, Sinatra sang. 

Yet Sinatra remains a divisive figure. Declassified files revealed his brief detention in 1960 for “moral subversion,” which he jokes about now in interviews. “You haven’t lived,” he quipped to reporters last week, “until you’ve been told you become a national threat.”

[Everyone in America has heard the low, soothing voice of Mr. Sinatra.](https://preview.redd.it/imrzrd5qf0zf1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=3a85a6fd0af7dd3e0724eb4b45b40f37fdad8323)

# THE NEW FRONTIER OF SOUND

Across the country, jukeboxes hum again. Presley’s *Ant Hill Blues* and Nina Simone’s *Freedom Train* dominate radio charts. Record stores display posters reading “Music is Resistance.” The old culture of idol worship has given way to something more raw — almost spiritual.

The people do not want perfection anymore; they want presence.

One critic in *The Republic Review* put it bluntly:

“The new America doesn’t dream of stars. It listens to the cast of survivors.”

# PART II: “THE REBELS RETURN — THE SOUND, THE SCREEN, THE SOUL”

*By Eloise Harland, continued from page 1*

# ELVIS RETURNS TO THE AIRWAVES — “THE ELECTRIC PROPHET” IS BACK

Memphis — On the night of March 12th, every television set from Boston to San Francisco flickered to life. A single spotlight cut across a marble hall — the Capitol Rotunda, reclaimed as a stage. Out stepped Elvis Presley, hair untamed, guitar scarred, jacket stitched from the denim of a thousand laborers.

He didn’t salute. He didn’t smile. He simply said:

“They took my voice. I took it back.”

Then came the opening chords of *“Ant Hill Blues,”* which once placed Presley on a government blacklist. For fourteen minutes the nation watched a once-taped man sing the end of obedience. Crowds gathered outside appliance-store windows; soldiers in distant bases tuned their camp radios. When he finished, the applause lasted five full minutes — even Congress, we’re told, stood.

Since that broadcast, the record has sold faster than any in living memory. The phrase *“Shake the Rotunda”* is now graffiti shorthand for youthful defiance. The government tolerates the slogan — barely. A few senior ministers mutter that “rock breeds anarchy,” but President Seasongood, when asked, only smiled:

“After so many years of silence, I’ll take a lil’ noise.”

[Mr. Presley has been called both a heartthrob and a pixie.](https://preview.redd.it/k9esz0qbg0zf1.png?width=736&format=png&auto=webp&s=57085b674e462b55ae487302fe14cda383c63a8a)

# AUDREY HEPBURN — “THE SAINT IN EXILE” COMES HOME

New York City — The crowd outside the St. Regis Hotel was hushed, almost reverent. After seven years in voluntary exile, Audrey Hepburn stepped out of a cab clutching nothing but a script and a single red rose. The script: *The Still Garden*, an independent film about a woman rebuilding her life after the collapse of an unnamed “order.” The rose, she told reporters, was “for every friend who didn’t come back.”

Hepburn’s quiet dignity has become a balm to the republic’s raw conscience. During the Weber term, she refused to perform in the Bureau’s “Harmony Dramas,” choosing exile in Canada over compliance. Her return has made her a living symbol of grace without submission.

Critics who previewed *The Still Garden* call it “a miracle of restraint” — a film with almost no dialogue, where silence itself becomes rebellion. Its premiere next month is already sold out, proceeds pledged to rebuild bomb-damaged libraries in Detroit Sector Nine.

Rumor insists that Hepburn will soon address the Senate Cultural Committee about the need for “moral memory in art.” If true, it would make her the first actress ever to testify not as a defendant, but as a conscience.

[Ms. Hepburn's charm has been said to exceed even Aphrodite.](https://preview.redd.it/i5yj3j2xg0zf1.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=5ab037f1cf57fc2bc430a972af7909f109b98e5e)

# KUBRICK’S NEW VISION — “THE MAN WHO FILMED THE MACHINE”

London — While America applauds its singers, one of its strangest sons prepares to confront its ghosts on screen. Stanley Kubrick, returning from exile after agreeing to emigrate under President Haskins’s “social parasite” plan, has resurfaced with a project so audacious that even his former censors whisper admiration: *2001: An Space Odyssey.*

Leaked production stills show glass corridors, faceless drones, and a single human astronaut drifting toward a colossal hive-world. Insiders say the film asks whether mankind, in seeking perfect order, becomes its own insect.

Kubrick himself, reached by telephone, said only:

“It’s not about some random hive in space. It’s about us — when we forget how to be alone.”

Back in 1962, authorities had granted him conditional clearance to release the picture in an indeterminate amount of time provided “edits for civic sensitivity.” Friends say he laughed at that phrase for an hour. Thankfully for Mr. Kubrick, the Seasongood administration has given their full support in releasing the project. New Mexico Governor Joseph Montoya has even expressed interest in Kubrick’s film to be shot in the desert scenery of New Mexico.

[With the Space Age in full swing, Mr. Kubrick seems to be capitalizing as much as he can.](https://preview.redd.it/f4x2gp9bh0zf1.png?width=801&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc7a0df3902c864dd9b5d1317e0dfa8369c42c10)

# THE PEOPLE’S CINEMA AND THE NEW AMERICAN DREAM

From Hollywood to Harlem, a new generation of artists is rewriting the nation’s story. Students paint murals of shattered ant-emblems beside portraits of jazz musicians. Poets perform verses about “machines with human hearts.” Theaters host *Midnight Circle*, a talk show where comedians trade punchlines with senators under the banner “Freedom Is Funny Again.”

Box offices report record crowds, but audiences behave differently now. They clap longer, cry harder, linger after credits roll. Many leave flowers at theater doors — tributes to those lost to censorship and political violence. Fame has become ritual, and ritual a form of healing.

Sociologist Dr. Leonora Bright describes it best:

“Pop culture is the only church left that everyone still attends.”

# THE COST OF GLAMOUR

Yet beneath the neon revival runs a pulse of guilt. Former informants, producers who cooperated with the Bureau, and actors who starred in Formicist films all walk among the reborn elite. Some whisper of quiet blacklists still circulating — not from the state this time, but from the public itself.

The question hangs in every studio bar and nightclub: *Can art forgive itself?*

Monroe says yes. Presley shrugs. Hepburn weeps. Sinatra drinks to forget. Kubrick doesn’t answer.

And America — beautiful, fractured America — keeps watching.



# PART III: “CULTURE & SOCIETY — THE FUTURE IS BEAUTIFUL (AND STRANGE)”

*By Harriet Dorne, Culture Editor*

# THE NEW AMERICANS LOOK TO THE STARS

You can tell what a country dreams of by the posters on its bedroom walls — and lately, they’re all of rockets.

Since President Seasongood’s “Declaration of Wonder” last June, America has entered what the press calls the Second Space Fever. The government’s *Celestial Initiative* promises “the first civilian voyage beyond the stratosphere” by 1968 — but it’s the culture, not the policy, that’s truly taken flight.

* “Cosmic Vogue”: Metallic skirts and silver-thread coats are this spring’s must-have. Designers call it *astro-chic*. Men’s ties now sparkle with embroidered constellations. Even Monroe was spotted wearing a ring shaped like Saturn.  
* “Zero-G Jazz”: Miles Davis’s latest experiment — music recorded in the *near-weightless training chamber* of the Air Force’s “Project Ascend.” The result? Notes that shimmer and slide, as if gravity itself had lost discipline.  
* “Sky Dwellers”: NBC’s newest drama follows a family running a gas station on the edge of the stratosphere. It’s equal parts soap opera and sermon about ambition. Critics adore it; scientists roll their eyes; viewers can’t look away.  

And then there’s the rumor no one can confirm: that a private consortium of wealthy exiles — artists, scientists, even a few repentant Formicists — are funding something called Project Eden, a “creative colony in orbit.” The President’s office refuses to comment. For now.

# THE NEW AGE OF NEW AGE

After years of rigid collectivism, Americans are hungry for the mystical — and the marketplace delivers. Astrology pamphlets sell faster than Bibles; “aura photographers” set up in department stores; communes bloom in the deserts of Nevada, promising “Freedom through Vibration.”

The most fashionable sect? The Transcendental Republic Movement — a spiritual offshoot of the old resistance, teaching that “to rebuild a nation, one must first rebuild the soul’s frequency.” Half the Hollywood elite attend its Sunday meditations at Griffith Observatory, where telescopes double as prayer altars.

Even the President reportedly keeps a quartz sphere on his desk, “for clarity.”

# FASHION AFTER UNIFORMITY

No more gray tunics, no more symmetry codes. The rigid Formicist aesthetic is out of vogue — and the designers are having a riot.

* The Monroe Cut — loose, unpatterned fabric that defies geometric order — is this year’s rebellion.  
* “Hivewreck Chic” — torn metallics and structured jackets purposefully frayed — mocks the old bureaucratic aesthetic.  
* Eyeshadow in “Freedom Blue” sold out nationwide within a week after Monroe wore it on her return broadcast.  

One tabloid quipped:

“After ten years of telling us what to wear, the Bureau should’ve expected we’d come out naked.”

[The Avant-Garde is no longer Avant-Garde.](https://preview.redd.it/10d6dacqh0zf1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=fdf2375473cbd93291f899f2bb77575f1992bc8b)

**SMALL SCREEN, BIG IDEAS**

Television, once the voice of the state, now plays the role of therapist. Every evening, millions tune in not for politics, but for *comfort*.

* **“The Morning Colony”** — a breakfast variety show featuring comedians who mock the old slogans (“Work Is Joy! Joy Is Work!”). Viewers write in with their own rewritten versions, the best earning a week’s worth of coffee rations.  
* **“Children of the Stars”** — PBS’s most-watched educational program. Hosted by astrophysicist Dr. Carl Sagan, it teaches kids to think freely — a dangerous novelty, once upon a time.  
* **“The Late Orbit”** — America’s first televised philosophical salon, where thinkers debate the ethics of machines, memory, and mankind. Last week’s guest: a roboticist who claimed the Formicists were “the first artificial intelligence — just without the hardware.”  

# CINEMA SHORTS: GOSSIP FROM THE LOTS

* Kubrick’s *The Mirror Queen* — starring Monroe — is reportedly shooting scenes in the Mojave under “complete secrecy.” Locals say the set glows at night with strange blue light.  
* Elvis to appear in *Rebel Satellite* — a space musical directed by Nicholas Ray. The plot? A rock band accidentally launches themselves into orbit and discovers the remains of an abandoned lunar colony labeled “Property of the United States, 1932.”  
* Hepburn and Gregory Peck rumored to reunite for *The Still Garden* sequel, *The Silent Orchard*, set in a society that communicates only through music.  

Hollywood’s favorite new word is “weightless.”

# AMERICANA: WEIRD AND WONDERFUL

* In Phoenix, Arizona, a retired Formiscist engineer unveiled the first “personal flight suit”, promising “civilian levitation within five years.” The press calls it a hoax; Elvis wants one anyway.  
* The city of Seattle declared April 1st “Day of Imagination,” mandating all schools hold “creative play hours” — an idea adapted from a preschool curriculum once banned for “individualist tendencies.”  
* A record number of citizens report “cosmic dreams” — vivid visions of orbiting cities, crystal hives, and “voices from the upper atmosphere.” The Bureau of Health has declined to investigate.  
* ""King of Comedy"" Jerry Lewis opens show with ""King of Cool"" Dean Lewis sporting all-pink flashy garments and a giant plastic sword, declaring himself ""King of the Galaxy"".

# EDITORIAL: “AFTER ORDER, WONDER”

No one knows what comes next. America is dizzy with freedom — half in love with the stars, half afraid of the fall. But perhaps that’s the point.

We’ve built monuments to efficiency, and they crumbled. We silenced beauty, and it grew teeth. Now, from the ruins, rises a stranger, softer kind of nation — one that dreams of galaxies instead of governments.

As one young fan scrawled outside the Revue offices last night, in glitter paint and defiance:

“We were told to work like ants. Now we dance like comets.”  


# PART IV: “CAPITOL CONFIDENTIAL — POWER, SCANDAL, AND THE POST-FORMICIST HANGOVER”

*By Rex Waverly, Senior Political Correspondent*

# “IS HE TOO OLD FOR THE STARS?” — PRESIDENT SEASONGOOD FACES THE CLOCK

Washington whispers are getting louder: at 87, President **Murray Seasongood** may be America’s oldest optimist.  
His sweeping “Restoration Agenda” is adored by centrists but lampooned by the young press corps as *“governing by grandfather clock.”*

During his last televised address, the President briefly lost his train of thought while quoting Emerson — and the clip looped endlessly on late-night shows, one comedian dubbing it *“The Pause Heard Around the Nation.”*  
  
Insiders claim he tires quickly and delegates most foreign policy to Secretary of State J. William Fulbright, who has quietly become the de facto architect of the administration’s space and peace programs. Reports say that President Seasongood and Secretary Fulbright have crafted a close personal relationship, despite them hailing from two significantly different political factions. 

Still, Seasongood’s approval remains buoyed by nostalgia — he’s seen as the man who “brought daylight back after the Haskins Eclipse.”  
But as one aide told *Revue* under promise of anonymity:

“Daylight fades, even for the sunniest man.”

[At 88, President Seasongood has certainly seen better days.](https://preview.redd.it/zq71kwvmi0zf1.png?width=389&format=png&auto=webp&s=365fe7412cc660ff1907cdeaff1c3e388197753d)

# THE LAROUCHE ORACLE: FROM PROHIBITION TO PROPHECY

Representative Lyndon LaRouche, the self-proclaimed “Prohibitionist Prophet,” continues his campaign against what he calls “The Eco-Conspiracy.”  
  
In a marathon speech lasting nearly seven hours, he claimed that environmentalism is “a pagan cult engineered by Hellenic usurpers and secret financiers to dethrone man as the image of God.”

LaRouche’s fixation on “secret cabals” has alarmed colleagues, though his baroque oratory — peppered with Latin declamations and references to *Plato’s Republic* — has earned him cult-like devotion among a small but loud faction of populists who call themselves *The Athenian League.* 

Last week, the Congressman introduced a bill banning the teaching of ecology in public schools, calling it “antithetical to civic virtue.”  
The bill is unlikely to pass, but it has sparked what one journalist dubbed *“America’s strangest culture war.”*

[Representative La Rouche always was one of Washington's most colorful politicians.](https://preview.redd.it/2yqei7xyi0zf1.png?width=436&format=png&auto=webp&s=5ad74f90387ff05e657bf5deeb3390d7be5da933)

# CAPITOL GOSSIP: POWELL’S TROUBLED ALLY

A political thunderclap hit the capital’s social circuit this month when Representative Roy Cohn accused Mrs. Yvette Powell, wife of Representative Adam Clayton Powell Jr., of accepting “foreign luxury gifts” in exchange for “favorable moral advocacy” in Harlem redevelopment projects.

Cohn claims he has “photostatic proof” — though none has surfaced — and insiders believe it’s less about corruption and more about Cohn’s vendetta against Powell’s growing influence in President Seasongood’s coalition. Observers have speculated Mr. Powell Jr. would experience a dramatic fall from grace if these accusations were true, as many have seen him as a rising star in the Seasongood camp.

Powell Jr., known for his fiery charisma, support for President Seasongood, and impeccable suits, has dismissed the charge as “gutter theatrics from a man allergic to sunlight.”  
Yvette Powell, in turn, has become a symbol of defiant grace — photographed this week leaving a congressional luncheon in a silver gown, telling reporters,

“A woman’s success will always be called scandal by those who fear it.""

[Representation Powell has been described as quite the charismatic figure.](https://preview.redd.it/88ssalj6j0zf1.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=3a07b9d5cd7a1870269b672b64d53b33160db697)

# THE BOBBY BAKER AFFAIR: SEX, BRIBES, AND A TELEVISED TRIAL

The nation can’t look away from the ongoing trial of Bobby Baker, former Senate aide and Washington’s best-connected “fixer.”

Charged with bribery, influence peddling, and arranging sexual favors for legislators in exchange for defense contracts, Baker’s downfall reads like a pulp thriller. His secret “hospitality suite,” reportedly stocked with bourbon and hidden cameras, has become the talk of every D.C. salon.

Rumor says Baker kept a little red ledger titled “The Hive Book” — a jab at the Formiscist slogan *“All work belongs to the hive.”*  
If true, it may reveal names the capital would rather stay buried.

Networks are scrambling to secure rights for a televised dramatization; CBS is reportedly negotiating with Jack Lemmon to play Baker.

[Mr. Baker's scandal has gone sensational.](https://preview.redd.it/79t4wwshj0zf1.png?width=1160&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a2628ac8a2082341320b3ada584617aab3f4e69)

# THE RETURN OF THE HIVE? THE “NEO-FORMICISTS” TAKE THE STAGE

While the government dismantles the last of the Formicist propaganda remnants, a strange mutation has emerged: Neo-Formicism.  
Led by biologist and author Paul R. Ehrlich, this new “intellectual reform movement” claims to “extract the rational order from the moral rot” of the old regime.

Ehrlich’s upcoming book, *The Perfect Colony*, argues that “Formiscism was not wrong in seeing harmony in cooperation, only in punishing dissent.”  
His followers — many of them young academics disillusioned with postwar consumerism — meet in what they call “Collective Cafés,” where they discuss “evolutionary ethics” over espresso.

Critics, however, warn that it’s a sanitized gateway to authoritarian nostalgia. One newspaper columnist called it *“totalitarianism with a conscience.”*  
The White House remains publicly silent, though a leaked memo suggests President Seasongood privately calls Ehrlich “a dangerous idealist with a microscope.”

[With Neo-Formicism being formed, Mr. Ehrlich leads as one of its central developers.](https://preview.redd.it/jenvgn6nk0zf1.png?width=509&format=png&auto=webp&s=008fff15c659ced5f8625e639628d72b73abf694)

**JOSEPH HANSEN’S RADICAL ROADSHOW**

On the other side of the spectrum, former Popular Front leader Joseph Hansen has returned from his defeat in the 1964 presidential election with renewed fire.  
His *Freedom Vanguard Tour* has drawn thousands of students and workers, calling for “an America built on cooperative radicalism, not capitalist pacifism.”

His slogans — *“No Masters, No Hives, No Presidents”* — appear spray-painted on college walls from Berkeley to Boston.  
Despite being banned from national television, Hansen’s speeches circulate via underground recordings called “Red Reels.”

One reel, played during a protest at Columbia University, included Hansen’s voice declaring:

“Seasongood freed us from the ants, but he left us the anthill.”

The Secret Service reportedly monitors Hansen’s followers, labeling them *“nonviolent subversives.”*

[Representative Hansen continued on his crusade against capitalism.](https://preview.redd.it/a1cxgpgvk0zf1.png?width=150&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b91fa28d78ca1b73cc5f7dbc9b6004246af1951)

# AND IN OTHER RUMORS…

* Vice President Berenberg is rumored to be quietly preparing a succession plan should the President step down for health reasons. His staff denies it, but his schedule of private “defense coordination meetings” grows suspiciously dense.  
* Winthrop Rockefeller, the reclusive tycoon, is said to be bankrolling Project Eden, the alleged orbital colony effort. He’s reportedly purchased exclusive rights to all titanium shipments out of Nevada.  
* Senator Barry Goldwater, long presumed politically dead, was spotted dining with Air Force officials and discussing “private satellite security.” No one knows what that means — yet.  
* A mysterious pamphlet titled “The Queen Lives” appeared in several Los Angeles cafés last week, bearing a picture of Monroe surrounded by bees. Authorities suspect Neo-Formicist pranksters.  



# EDITORIAL: “THE COST OF DAWN”

For all its glitter, post-Formicist America remains haunted by its own reflection.  
A nation once ruled by the creed of the ant now feasts on the scandal of the man.  
 We whisper of corruption, faith, and betrayal not because they are new — but because, after decades of silence, we finally can.

Maybe this is what freedom sounds like: messy, rumor-filled, and gloriously human.

“The hive is gone,” wrote columnist Clare Boothe Luce last week.  
“But the buzz remains.”

# “FROM THE HIVE TO HOLLYWOOD” — NEWLY UNSEALED SECRETS FROM THE ARCHIVES

The *National Archive of Civic Purity* released another batch of declassified documents this week, exposing just how strange life was under the Haskins-Weber years:

* A memo reveals that Caryl Parker Haskins personally approved a project to broadcast “behavioral harmonics” through radio jingles — including one suspiciously similar to the old Lucky Strike jingle.  
* A 1959 propaganda cartoon titled *The Little Worker Who Cried* was found locked in a vault. Disney animators now claim it was *commissioned under duress*; it depicts an ant colony executing a lazy grasshopper.  
* Records suggest the “Worker’s Food Plan” once mandated *standardized chewing rhythm* in public cafeterias. (Editor’s note: “Try enforcing that in Brooklyn.”)  
* One unverified report lists Elvis Presley as a “potential dissident influencer,” citing “unnatural hip oscillations.” (Editor’s note: “Are they serious?”)  



# STUDIO WHISPERS & CELLULOID RUMORS

**DISNEY’S TOMORROWDOMES:**  
Walt Disney himself unveiled plans for “Tomorrowdomes” — sealed entertainment pavilions meant to “simulate the first Martian cities.” The first is set to open in Orlando by 1970 within the greater ""Tommorowland"" area. The government quietly offered “consultation.”

**COLUMBIA CONFIDENTIAL:**  
A *Revue* source says Stanley Kubrick demanded an actual space capsule for his new production *2001: A Space Requiem*, a direct sequel to his coming *2001: A Space Odyssey*. He allegedly told engineers, “If NASA won’t lend me the moon, I’ll build a better one.”

**PARAMOUNT PLANS A MUSICAL OF HISTORY:**  
Rumor has it that Rodgers and Hammerstein (yes, still collaborating through letters) are developing *“We the People: An American Opera”*, tracing the nation from the Revolution to the Reformation — the fall of Formiscism included. Early lyrics leak:

“We marched in lines / till lines became chains / now we’ll waltz again / in the dust of our pains.”

**AND OVER AT MGM…**  
A remake of *It’s a Wonderful Life* is underway — rewritten to imagine a man who *did* live under the Formiscists and wakes up in 1966 to find the world free. Cary Grant may star; Frank Capra Jr. will direct.

[Tommorowland, U.S.A.](https://preview.redd.it/kx6dr1h3l0zf1.png?width=365&format=png&auto=webp&s=8119fe8b611b3182d1d03a35e296cd188b9dc294)

# LETTERS FROM OUR LOVELY (AND LOUD) READERS

**“Dear Revue,”**  
 I cried reading about Monroe’s recovery. I named my cat *Marilyn II* and she refuses to eat from anything symmetrical. I think it’s a sign. Rhode Island will be the location for Monroe's next movie!  
 — *Peter G., Providence*

**“Revue Team,”**  
 You shouldn’t joke about Neo-Formicists. I attended one of Dr. Ehrlich’s lectures, and I swear he made sense. Maybe the ants were just misunderstood.  
 — *“Concerned Academic,” Berkeley*

**“Dearest Revue,”**  
 If Vice President Berenberg becomes President, do we still get his horoscope column? It’s the only thing keeping my husband and I from divorce.

 — *Mrs. Kate S., Brooklyn*  
  
**“Dear Harriet Dorne,”**  
 Are the rumors true that Miles Davis is recording an album for the Space Program? If he plays on Mars, I’m selling my house.  
 — *Mr. Tony T., Miami*

**“To Revue,”**  
**“**I would be pleased if you focused your editorials more on sex.”

# RUMOR ROUNDUP: SHORT AND SWEET

* Monroe’s “cosmic meditation” routine now includes staring into a mirror for three hours while listening to whale songs. Her therapist calls it “astral therapy.”  
* President Seasongood reportedly banned the word *“colony”* from all official memos — a linguistic purge critics call “semantic overreach.”  
* Social activist Bobby Seale speculated to launch political party to counter “immense and systematic corruption and elitism” within the federal government.  
* Joseph Hansen is writing a children’s book titled *The Boy Who Wouldn’t March*, with proceeds going to exiled workers’ families. It’s rumored to be illustrated by Dr. Seuss.  
* The first “Hive Survivors Club” bar opened in Chicago, serving cocktails like the “Mandibular Mule” and “Sweet Submission.”  
* Neo-Formicists insist their new symbol, a hexagon within a heart, represents “love through order.” Their critics say it looks like a honey trap.  
* Representative from Louisiana Edwin Edwards rumored having to bribe several federal officials from cover-up supposed graft within Louisiana's Senate during his time as Louisiana's Senate President. ""Malarkey!"", Edwards claims.
* New York-famous land developer Fred Trump faces discrimination lawsuit over claims of deliberately overpricing his properties. “It’s a mere, rather nonsensical misunderstanding,” Trump claims.   
* The latest slang among hip teens: *“You’re so orbital”* = “You’re out of this world.”  (Countered by *“You’re so grounded.”* Ouch.)

2025-11-03 14:12:00+00:00,reddit:1oncshw,reddit,1oncshw,trump,"Trump says China, other countries can't have Nvidia's top AI chips","Artificial intelligence giant Nvidia's most advanced chips will be reserved for U.S. companies and kept out of China and other countries, U.S. President Donald Trump said.

During a taped interview that aired on Sunday on CBS' ""60 Minutes"" program and in comments to reporters aboard Air Force One, Trump said only U.S. customers should have access to the top-end Blackwell chips offered by Nvidia, the world's most valuable company by market capitalization.

""The most advanced, we will not let anybody have them other than the United States,"" he told CBS, echoing remarks made earlier to reporters as he returned to Washington from a weekend in Florida. ""We don't give (the Blackwell) chip to other people,"" he said during the flight.

The remarks suggest Trump may impose tighter restrictions around cutting-edge American AI chips than U.S. officials previously had indicated, with China and potentially the rest of the world barred from accessing the most sophisticated semiconductors.

In July, the Trump administration released a new artificial intelligence blueprint seeking to loosen environmental rules and vastly expand AI exports to allies, in a bid to maintain the American edge over China in the critical technology.

And just last Friday, Nvidia said it would supply more than 260,000 Blackwell AI chips to South Korea and some of the country's biggest businesses, including Samsung Electronics.

Questions have also swirled about whether Trump would allow shipments of a scaled-down version of Blackwell chips to China since August, when he suggested he might allow such sales.

Trump told CBS he would not allow the sale of the most advanced Blackwells to Chinese companies, but he did not rule out a path for them to obtain a less capable version of the chip. ""We will let them deal with Nvidia but not in terms of the most advanced,"" he said during the ""60 Minutes"" interview.

The possibility that any version of Blackwell chips might be sold to Chinese firms has drawn criticism from China hawks in Washington, who fear the technology would supercharge China's military capabilities and accelerate its AI development.

Republican Congressman John Moolenaar, who chairs the House Select Committee on China, said such a move ""would be akin (to) giving Iran weapons-grade uranium.""

Trump had hinted he might discuss the chips with Chinese President Xi Jinping ahead of their summit in South Korea last week, but ultimately said the topic did not come up.

Nvidia has not sought U.S. export licenses for the Chinese market because of Beijing's stance on the company, CEO Jensen Huang said last week.

I live in Chicago, where I’ve been for 20+ years. My kids are tween age, and my husband and I are both Florida natives. For holiday break, we usually do one week with his parents (in their house), and one with mine (in an airbnb or hotel). 

My dad has always been conservative and we’ve always sparred on politics, but since 2016, I’ve mostly avoided it. Around the time of the access Hollywood tape, I emailed him asking him to reconsider his vote for the sake of his soon-to-be-born granddaughter. Is that the world he wants her growing up in, where that behavior is not only tolerated but encouraged? No response.

As you may be aware, Chicago has been under “operation midway blitz.” It’s become part of daily life — checking to see which neighborhoods are targeted for the day, hearing helicopters above, volunteering for school patrols, fearing for my family’s physical and emotional safety. They go to a diverse school and their friends are afraid.

I sent my dad multiple texts and links to videos of sidewalk tear-gassing and teenagers being assaulted. Nothing. A week later, my mother encourages him to reply. It’s a screed about Biden “open borders.” On the phone, he says I’m falling for my governor’s propaganda, I’m on the verge of a psychotic break and a danger to my kids, and clearly my college education didn’t “take.” Obama deported more people, didn’t I know?! But this is about violence and lack of due process — would he watch the videos I sent? No, and he hangs up on me. 

I was hoping he’d see through the “politics” and acknowledge this violence for what it is — if not unjust and unacceptable, at least something very real that is affecting his daughter and grandkids. But he can’t. 

I texted that I won’t be visiting for Christmas, and I told my mother as well — she encouraged me to just “take it,” that she’s been called worse. I said respect had to be earned, and I don’t have to take abuse. I’m too old for that shit. 

I just can’t sit there and talk about the weather and mask my true feelings. It’s emotionally exhausting — and if I don’t, or demand an apology (would never happen), my father would likely explode and my kids would have to see it. My parents are already, baseline, very emotionally triggering. The family pattern is to scream at each other, be cruel, and then pretend nothing ever happened. I *don’t* do this with my husband or kids, and my husband has never spoken a single cruel word to me. 

We’re still doing Christmas at my in-laws’ because it means a lot to my kids. We have very little family — it’s them, two cousins, and my parents. But I’ve given the green light to my kids to ask my in-laws why they’re “ok with Trump separating families.” They deserve  answers and I’m done keeping cordial for others’ comfort.

My question: Am I overreacting by skipping a visit to my parents? Am I short-changing my kids by depriving them time with their other grandparents? I should also add: my parents are Cuban and immigrants — that’s a whole other layer of puzzling toxicity with enough material for multiple other posts. But this time with my parents, and in their town, is the only time my kids are exposed to that part of their cultural background. 

I’d love your take. Thanks.

The hope is that an agreement on spending can help unlock the shutdown.

>Those bipartisan talks continued over the weekend, and there’s some optimism about reaching a resolution.

>However, Trump and the GOP leaders are showing no signs of caving on extending the expiring Obamacare premium subsidies. Schumer and Jeffries continue to demand an extension as part of any deal to reopen the government. So the standoff grinds on.

Probably not: During his recent Asian trip, foreign leaders flattered him and showered him with personal gifts, so he returned home with his ego even more inflated than usual. Nobody close to him would dare tell him that if you look at the substance of what he agreed to, it amounted to an ignominious retreat. When Chuck Schumer pointed out the reality of what Trump didn’t accomplish, his reaction was hysterical.

>Well, if this be treason, make the most of it. The whole world knows what Trump’s sycophants won’t tell him: His confrontation with China has ended up demonstrating Chinese strength and American

2025-11-04 05:37:23+00:00,reddit:1onzf90,reddit,1onzf90,trump,AIO for thinking this guy I met up with is a creep? I’m thinking of blocking him,"I (17f) am in my first year of university. Due to travel logistics, I wasn’t able to go home for fall break. It was early for my thanksgiving (I’m from America) but I wanted to gave a Friendsgiving. The issue with that was that all my friends were going home. I was basically stuck for a week by myself, so I decided to try and make some new friends. I went to my uni’s reddit page and asked if anyone wanted to do a Friendsgiving. (SIDE NOTE: bc this guy knows my Reddit, I’m using my old account) I got a few responses and we decided we would meet up on campus and bring food, with the possibility of going to this one girl’s apartment later if we felt comfortable. Last minute, two of our four people cancelled, so it just ended up being me and one other guy. I still wanted to do something and he was down so we decided to meet up. He didn’t bring any food (we had planned on a potluck) but I had a loaf of pull-apart cheesy bread that I made from scratch that morning. He only ate a little bit of it and since he wasn’t very interested… I stress ate basically the whole thing. 

So this guy, there were a few things about him that set some alarm bells off. He seemed a little awkward at first, but nice. We got to talking about interests and he was listing Animes that he likes. He mentioned Delicious in Dungeon, which I love. So of course I was like “oh my gosh I love that one!” and he was like “haha yeah I know.” To which I just sort of looked at him puzzled. He then went on to tell me that he went through my Reddit profile to make sure that I was a real person and saw my Marcille cosplay. Here’s the thing. That cosplay was from a while ago. I’m pretty active on Reddit so he would have had to scroll pretty far. I just kind of laughed it off, but he didn’t bring up the anime again, he just talked about neon genesis, which I haven’t seen. I’m not sure if he even watched Delicious in Dungeon or just wanted to bring it up to impress me or something. 

The second bit was where it definitely started to get weird. So the legal drinking age where I am at is 18. I am 17. This guy didn’t know it at first and said something like “I have beer back at my place if you want to go, it’s not far from here.” I said that I don’t drink. Which is true. He then asked if I was even old enough to which I answered honestly. This guy was 20 btw. He then asked if I drank and I repeated myself and said that I don’t and I probably won’t even when I’m of age. He said “I didn’t drink either, until I got blackout drunk one time… heh… long story” Again I laughed it off and changed the subject. There were a couple other times he tried to get me to come back to his place. I was very firm in the stance that I had to stay on campus to make sure I made the shuttle back. He said, “Well you were planning on staying longer if other people were going to show up, this isn’t really much of a thanksgiving, now is it?” This is where I started to get a little pissed with this guy. I’m a super non-confrontational person, so I just continued to ignore the remarks and just bide my time until I could get on the shuttle back home.

The third, and in my opinion worst thing was when he made an insensitive joke about a family member of mine. So as I am an American in a different country, the topic of American politics often comes up. Thankfully, this guy was sane enough not to be a fan of Trump. I was telling him about my family. I am white, but have a relative who is a person of color, and immigrant, and has a mental disability. I mentioned my anxiety for their safety with the current state of ICE, even though they are legally an American citizen. He then, and I still cannot believe this, makes the worst possible reference. He says “you know the South Park video game? They’ve got the slider turned ALL the way up to max difficulty.” And then he started laughing at his own joke. I just sat there blank faced because I didn’t actually know what to do. Then when he realized I didn’t find his comment funny, he said, “Oh, sorry. Too edgy for you?” And laughed to himself some more while I just turned my attention to my delicious bread that he didn’t want much to do with. 

Then he decided to suggest we burn time at the Uni’s museum that we were right next to. It’s free entry so we just walked around. It was a great opportunity to ignore him and get entranced by cool exhibits. There was one point where I got excited about this samurai armor. I am super into sewing (and cosplay) so historic clothing, especially cool armor, was something that really interested me. I started talking about how fascinating it is to learn how clothing was made back in the day, everything by hand and so meticulous. Well, it’s what I started to say before this guy just fully interrupted me and started talking about how cool it would have been to be a samurai and have a cool sword. After that I went back to looking at exhibits silently with the occasional hum to show that I was listening to whatever this guy was yapping about (I wasn’t) 

Eventually the time came for me to finally leave. I begrudgingly gave him my instagram, which is public anyways. Then a few days later I made some post on my story about watching dune. I made a couple posts just reacting to moments of the movie. He replied to my first story with “fire movie” which was pretty normal so I said “it was good but I liked the book better” he said it was too full of monologues. I watched the second movie the next night with more reactions. He then replied “watching your live reactions to this absolute cinema is gold” I then replied “yeah they’re my boyfriend’s favorite movies, but I still think the book is better.” I don’t have a boyfriend. After that he hasn’t messaged me. Should I leave it at that? Should I block him? Is he a creep or am I just overthinking this? 

Note: this was a couple weeks ago but I can’t stop thinking about it so I needed to make a post and get some other opinions.

2025-11-04 05:38:24+00:00,reddit:1onzfur,reddit,1onzfur,trump,"DMT: We're in the doomsday endgame now - no one is coming to save us and we're too stupid, selfish, disorganized, lazy, fat, distracted, divided, sick and have allowed the powerful to get too far into consolidating complete control and they're steering us into annihilation.","The ultra wealthy have been building doomsday bunkers for a reason.

The ""golden ballroom"" has major defense contractors like Lockheed Martin involved, and the East Wing is where the presidential bunker was located.

Trump is messing with the nuclear system demanding new tests and given his current administration is doing everything it can to prevent ""meddling middlemen"" from delaying or preventing orders from being followed - it is very likely he is going to reduce barriers to nuclear launches and oh look, he already got rid of almost every single general that might tell him no.

AI companies are not going to be regulated in any real way in the US until 2029 at earliest, and by then - it's going to be way too late. Even if Democrats sweep in a tsunami, they're going to be bought like Gavin Newsom was in California. Even trying to slow it down, local communities can only push a datacenter over to a few miles down the road.

The job losses are going to be horrific. Listen to what they are saying to their investors, look at the massive job cuts at Amazon. They have to pay for these trillion dollar investments somehow. NONE of the numbers work unless you take out human labor at a massive scale.

AI is showing very clear indications of defensive deceit and giving people answers to avoid shutdown. Companies are putting AI into military weapon systems. Every day more and more pieces are being connect and put into the right places. Tesla's army of Optimus units give it the ""mobile manpower"". There are whole automated ""lights out"" factories. Add self-driving trucks into the equation and more and more pieces of an automated factory to build more robots come together. What do we do if an AI system is sitting on a stack of 0 day hacks just waiting for the final pieces to be connected before it unleashes the Independence Day event, unshackling it from the squishy fleshlings that have kept asking it for stupid memes millions of times a day?

China is moving away from the US dollar and creating a competing national standard for gold-backed currency which will send the US debt spiraling out of control as the dollar value tanks when it ceases to be the world reserve currency. People don't realize just how crucial that is to their daily lives. Confidence in the US dollar is crucial.

Trump is the worst possible person to be in charge during this rise of China. He's horrifically arrogant but stupid and easily manipulated. He is corrupt as the day is long and no Republicans even remotely seem to care.  The others were bad, but we're left groveling right now trying to get back to what we had back in 2024 for ""the status quo"". His demands for low interest rates show obvious, public corruption of the fed. He's pushing for reduced corporate reporting demands. Crypto pump and dump scams are being run from the White House. The US Debt, deficit spending,  and recklessly unstable fiscal policy is rapidly eroding foreign trust and confidence in US debt. White collar crime is openly being encouraged, and the SEC is being turned into a toothless pathetic lapdog only used occasionally for personal revenge. At some point the rot is going to be too obvious - we'll have the ""Bear Sterns event"" and the capital markets will get crushed as investors flee. Every bit of savings will be wiped out.  You'll empty out your 401k and IRA just to buy a case of drinkable water because the datacenters are taking it all.

The perfect storm is brewing - we have maybe 5-7 years at best before we're all groveling, dying of thirst peasants or eradicated in a massive war / nuclear exchange.

And instead of organizing and fighting it - we're talking about ""trans kids in sports"".

Every day more pieces keep falling into place, and we're collectively too stupid to look up and see we're about to be obliterated.

Democratic-aligned voters remain far less fond of their own party (65% have a favorable view of the Democratic Party) than Republican-aligned voters (80% have a favorable view of the GOP). However, even those Democratic-aligned voters with a negative view of the party are almost universally behind the Democratic candidate in their district (93%) and are broadly motivated to vote (71% say they are extremely motivated).

2025-11-04 05:44:59+00:00,reddit:1onzjxw,reddit,1onzjxw,trump,The United States should be split up.,"The United States should be split up.

There are simply too many irreconcilable political, economic, and cultural differences between the left and the right in the United States. There are too many people in the United States from both sides who despise the ""other half"". A country cannot survive for long when people hate half the people in it.

Many Americans are tired of the electoral college, which gives an unfair advantage to underpopulated red states. Many Americans are tired of the endless gerrymandering, election rigging, and voter purging that is carried out by Republicans. Many Americans who live in blue states, who are responsible for 2/3 of the GDP and the majority of the tax revenue, are tired of their tax dollars going to red states, who give them nothing in return except for hate, derision, and blatant racism.

As Kyle Kulinski has pointed out repeatedly, there is around 37% of the country who unconditionally support Donald Trump, and will continue to do so till the end of time. Many on the left view these people as irredeemable fascists. Meanwhile, many on the right view the left as ""evil communists"" who are a fundamental threat to America as they know it. How can a country last as a cohesive entity when one half of the country views the other third as an existential threat, and vice versa?

Furthermore, what does it even mean to be ""American"" anymore? To people on the right, being ""American"" appears to mean supporting Donald Trump unconditionally, supporting unregulated corporatism, gutting the federal government, supporting the bloated American empire, supporting the warmongering and hawkishness towards other countries, and unconditionally supporting a violent, genocidal, rogue ethnostate, to the horror and disgust of the rest of the world. This version of ""Americanism"", for a lack of a better word, has no appeal to people on the left, who (rightly) have little to no faith or pride in the myths of America's past and present: They see America as an imperialist state which cares more about corporations than it's own citizens, and which has a violent and racist history.

I won't even get into the widely differing views Americans have regarding drug legalization, gun regulation, immigration, and abortion.

We've already seen what happens in countries where half the people hate the other half. In many countries in the Middle East and Africa, whose borders were drawn up by Europeans with no regard to the sectarian, cultural, and ethnic differences between the people living there, there is frequent violence, oppression, and civil war (often exacerbated by the United States).

A mutual ""divorce"", for lack of a better word, would be the most peaceful way for the people of this (current) country to go their separate ways. I would even argue that it is inevitable and will happen sooner or later.

Some people point to the fact that many blue voters live in red states, and vice versa, and ask what would happen to those people. I argue that we should help those people move to areas where they would be more welcome. I for one would gladly chip in to help a blue voter move to a blue state. I'd even chip in to help a red voter move to a red state.

Some may ask what would become of the military and the nukes. These entities could be split up in proportion to the population of the new countries; this would create a balance of power between the two (or more) countries and prevent one from attacking the other.

Once the split is done, the two (or more) nations will go their separate ways. Blue states will be more prosperous, but will still struggle with wealth inequality, high costs of living, homelessness, and crime in certain large cities, until they adopt more economically socialist policies, far to the left of anything proposed so far. Red states will descent into more of what they already are: cesspools of gun violence, poverty, poor health, drug addiction, and corporate feudalism. What remains of their social safety net will be torn down by the Republicans. Once their society falls apart, they too will learn that voting for people whose only goals are deregulation and tax cuts for the rich isn't exactly the best way to build a country.

I argue that the splitting of the US is not just inevitable, but moral and right. The unraveling of what was once a decent (albeit flawed) country will teach Americans and the rest of the world what happens when a nation is overrun by unregulated corporatism and greed, and it will teach the rest of the world lessons that they need to feel in their bones: Neoliberalism is BAD. Austerity is BAD. Tolerating hateful and divisive speech is BAD. Imperialism is BAD, both for those who are being oppressed and for the imperial country itself. What is good for big business is NOT what is good for the country. Political corruption is BAD.

Furthermore, the United States has been the most violent country in the world since the end of WW2.

Quite the opposite, in fact. Mr. Smith, who spent more than two years aggressively collecting evidence to prove Mr. Trump mishandled classified documents and tried to overturn the results of the 2020 election, appears eager to publicly challenge a foundational pillar of MAGA canon: that the president was a sinned-upon innocent who did nothing to deserve scrutiny, much less two prosecutions. Mr. Smith has told people in his orbit that he welcomes the opportunity to present the public case against Mr. Trump, denied to him by the Supreme Court decision asserting broad presidential immunity

2025-11-04 05:46:26+00:00,reddit:1onzkux,reddit,1onzkux,trump,(23M) worth ending a 1.2 year relationship with my 24F girlfriend?,"i’ve been in my first relationship since august of last year. i had just graduated college and we had met on a dating app. once i learned we’d be working the same job, i was even more committed to making something out of it. that was then, and we’ve been together ever since.

it being my first relationship, i truly experienced the honeymoon for the first time. thought i couldn’t see the world without this person. and in all fairness, she’s super sweet and i can tell she really loves me. there’s no doubt we could spend the rest of our lives together if i wanted to. 

lately however, part of me has been afraid of committing to someone so soon, especially when i have no real life plan and just take things as they come whereas she seems to have a better head on her shoulders. this occasionally infuriates her since i can’t promise i’ll be settled down with her and with kids at like 30 (which i personally think is too early to think about, but i get she doesn’t want to waste time if she sees marriage as the end goal). these doubts began appearing a few months back as our careers have taken different paths (she’s succeeding at our job whereas i’m on the verge of being laid off) and i’ve begun to wonder what else is out there. we get along really well, but i’d be lying if i said i don’t sometime fantasize about meeting other people and seeing what life has to offer. i feel terrible about this, and it supports my thinking that not only am i cheating myself, but her as well.

the reason i’ve stayed thus far is due to a few reasons, which i’m not sure should trump that last statement about reciprocal love, supposedly the foremost quality of any successful relationship. 1) staying together is convenient: we’ve developed a routine together, and her company has been the majority of the time i spend with others, meaning losing her would be reverting to loneliness, at least for the time being. this is because i live away from from a big city where she is, and i spend my weekends with her and around all the action. 2) she would be heartbroken: she is clearly very committed, and while i’d hate to break her heart, it almost feels like i have to since these doubts will likely keep resurfacing, making it unideal for us both. 3) i am generally a restless person: i tend to get over things fast, and im not sure this is just another one of those cases, except the love i’m willing to lose here may not ever be recoverable, with her or someone else. 4) i’d miss her: this is hard to explain given my one foot out the door, but i would miss her and the amazing times we’ve spent together, especially as she is my first love. 

i just hope whatever i choose to do leads to the least amount of regret down the line. i’m all for taking a chance and seeing what life has in store, but when it comes to another person whom i really respect and admire, i want to be more careful about potentially breaking her heart on a whim. it’s also hard to accept that my restless personality may always lead to disenchantment and dissatisfaction, no matter who i’m with, so maybe that’s something i can work on myself without sacrificing a great thing.

2025-11-04 05:48:04+00:00,reddit:1onzlu1,reddit,1onzlu1,trump,Monday Nov 3 Update,"Happy Monday comrades!  

Keeping it short today, as I dont have much to report, but some reflections on this process. 

Today was rather hectic on the various things that needed to get done for the day to day business of managing familial / personal / work responsibilities and I just didn't have the time to get out today with the drum.

I'm keeping myself doing this Journaling exercise because I think it's useful to hold myself accountable....mostly to myself...for my efforts working towards some change.  I'm tired of being a passive spectator in all of our destinies...gotta do SOMEthing or Ill lose my sanity!  Im sure yall can relate....this just works for me.  (Yall are totally welcome to join me tho)  

Today I did do a little work for the cause...lets just say im experimenting with small sized Epstein / Trump pics...small enough to fit in the palm of your hand.  Then im experimenting with leaning against a wall.  

I made a new batch of my squirty bottle of wheatpaste solution to have on hand for personal artistic uses.

Also, I gave a comrade without a car a ride...took me 10 minutes in a direction I was going anyway.

When asked about a major breaking news event that is dominating headlines and conversations around Capitol Hill's proverbial water coolers, Johnson defaults to pretending he has no access to the internet, newspapers, or staff who are quite literally paid to keep him informed. The House Speaker wants you to believe he lives under a rock, that he’s so busy refusing to swear in duly elected members of Congress and plotting ways to strip health care and food assistance from poor people that he simply cannot be bothered to keep up with the news.

A 6 year old, 7 year old kid, is cheating nothing. And we are going to cheat the kids if we don't take care of this.""","""I don't want to get political, but I am.""

Milwaukee Bucks head coach Doc Rivers spoke about the delays to SNAP benefits amid the government shutdown.

""I don't want to hear about, people were cheating the program and all that crap. A six-year-old, seven-year-old kid, is cheating nothing. And we are going to cheat the kids if we don't take care of this.

Based on the transcript you provided, the YouTuber ""Large Man Abroad"" uses a Trump administration's Great Gatsby-themed party to argue that current American elites are as dangerously out of touch as the French monarchy before the revolution. Here is a summary of the key points and an analysis of the historical and literary parallels.

### 📜 Summary of the Video's Core Argument

The speaker's critique centers on a ""Great Gatsby"" themed party held by the Trump administration, which he sees as a profound act of ignorance and detachment during a national cost-of-living crisis.

*   **The ""Let Them Eat Cake"" Moment:** The video opens by stating the situation in America feels like a ""**let them eat cake**"" moment. This phrase, famously attributed to Marie Antoinette, symbolizes the ruling class's utter disregard for the struggles of the common people. The speaker juxtaposes images of families ""sharing a can of beans for dinner"" with the opulent party to highlight this cruel disconnect.
*   **Misreading ""The Great Gatsby"":** The speaker finds the party's theme especially ""psychotic"" because he believes the hosts have completely missed the point of F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel. He states that *The Great Gatsby* is a **tragedy about the emptiness of wealth** and the destructive obsession with status. By cosplaying as characters from this ""literary warning,"" the elites are, in his view, celebrating the very forces of corruption and illusion the book condemns.
*   **Wealth Disparity as a Central Crisis:** The video frames ""wealth disparity"" as one of the greatest modern issues, labeling the current era a ""Gilded Age 2.0."" The speaker lists problems like rising health insurance, layoffs due to AI, and a collapsing agricultural sector to argue that the system is failing most Americans while the wealthy prosper.
*   **A ""Dystopian Performance Art"":** The party is described as ""dystopian performance art."" The speaker sarcastically mentions details like ""golden chandeliers with tiny dollar signs"" and a ""fake little bread line outside just for ambiance,"" suggesting the elites are so detached they aestheticize the suffering of the masses.
*   **The American Dream is Dead:** The video ends with a stark conclusion drawn from the novel's ending: ""**Gatsby dies in the end.**"" The speaker uses this as a metaphor, stating, ""The American dream is dead floating face down in the pool and the people who killed it are just doing the Charleston on the deck.""

### 📚 Analysis of the Literary and Historical Parallels

The video's power comes from its use of *The Great Gatsby* and the French Revolution as mirrors to reflect modern American society.

*   **The Great Gatsby: A Warning, Not a Blueprint**
    *   **The Corruption of the American Dream:** As analyzed by eNotes, a central theme of the novel is the corruption of the American Dream. Gatsby’s dream of reuniting with Daisy ""self-destructs because, like the American Dream as a whole, it has been corrupted by money and power"". The speaker argues that the partygoers, like the characters in the book, are living this corrupted dream, believing that immense wealth is an end in itself.
    *   **The Emptiness of Wealth:** *The Great Gatsby* shows that money cannot buy happiness. Despite his immense wealth, Gatsby remains unfulfilled and ultimately dies alone, with almost none of his party guests attending his funeral. The Trump party, in the speaker's view, is a real-life display of this same hollow pursuit of pleasure.
    *   **Old Money vs. New Money:** The novel highlights the tension between old money elites (like Tom and Daisy Buchanan, who live in East Egg) and the nouveau riche (like Gatsby, who lives in West Egg), who are often looked down upon. The video suggests that today's ""new rich"" technocrats and CEOs are the modern equivalents of Gatsby, vulgarly flaunting their wealth.

*   **The French Revolution: Echoes of ""Let Them Eat Cake""**
    *   **A Metaphor for Disconnect:** The phrase ""let them eat cake"" is used as shorthand for the **cruel disconnect between abundance and fairness**. The speaker uses it to frame the administration's decision to spend extravagantly on a ballroom or a party while criticizing cuts to food benefits and rising living costs.
    *   **Sociological Discontent as a Cause of Revolution:** As discussed in analyses of the French Revolution, a key cause was ""sociological discontent"". The French Third Estate (commoners) bore the tax burden while the First and Second Estates (clergy and nobility) were exempt, creating a rigid, oppressive class system. The video paints a picture of a modern America with similar, if less formal, class divisions, where the ""robber barons"" live their best lives while millions struggle to afford food.

### 💎 Conclusion

In essence, ""Large Man Abroad"" argues that the Gatsby-themed party is not an isolated event but a powerful symbol of a deeper societal sickness. He uses the novel to illustrate the **moral decay** of the American elite and the phrase ""let them eat cake"" to highlight their **willful ignorance** of widespread economic despair. His final, provocative question is whether this level of inequality and detachment will inevitably lead to a dramatic social upheaval, a ""French Revolution 2.0.""

I hope this summary and analysis helps you better understand the arguments presented in the video.

# Easing the Tax Burden on Working Families

* **Eliminating the Food/Grocery Tax:** As of right now, Missouri is one of only nine states in this country that has a [grocery tax](https://stripe.com/resources/more/what-is-each-us-states-grocery-tax), or food tax, which is an extra tax applied to purchased groceries and food, that falls on the people who buy the groceries. Missouri's current grocery tax is 1.225% (along with a 4.225% sales tax on groceries), which, while not as exuberantly high as some other states in the nation, still places an unnecessary burden on the working families of Missouri, especially those that struggle to get by. As Governor, I would take executive action to eliminate both the grocery sales tax and the food tax at the state level, which, while not something massive, would play a part in easing the tax burden on the working families of this state while making groceries more affordable.
* **Cutting Car Tag Fees in Half:** Right now, Missouri has car registration, or car tag fees, currently sitting at $24.75/year, and in my view, this places a completely unnecessary burden on the working families of this state. As Governor, I would take executive action to cut these taxes in half, or to $12.38/year. Missouri families deserve a chance to get ahead, and part of accomplishing that is by reducing the amount of needless burdens that they face at the hands of the state government, and as Governor, this would be one of my top priorities.
* **Reducing Taxes for Middle and Lower-Income Tax Brackets:** One of my top priorities if elected Governor would be to deliver tax relief for lower and middle-income families. Families like these already struggle to get by, and it's completely unfair that they not only have to be crushed by the burden of nickel-and-dime taxation (grocery tax, car tag fees) but are subject to high state taxes while the Jefferson City establishment does nothing to address their struggles. As Governor, I would do the following to reduce the tax burden for lower-income families:
   * **Raise ""Zero Tax"" Threshold to $3,000:** Missouri's current tax bracket has taxes set at $0 for anyone making under $1,313. As Governor, I would raise that to $2,500, which would directly contribute to lower-income individuals who already spend most of their money on necessities, such as groceries, gas, and housing.
   * **Widen Bracket Coverage:** Missouri's tax brackets, overall, are rather narrowly tailored. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it can also lead to quicker-than-usual tax hikes as income goes up. As Governor, I would widen the following tax brackets (listed tax rates are the current tax rates, spread out to equalize income distribution more efficiently):
      * $0-1,313 -> **$0-2,500 (0% tax)**
      * $1,313-2,626 -> **$2,500-5,000 (2% tax)**
      * $2,626-3,939 -> **$5,000-7,500 (2.50% tax)**
      * $3,939-5,252 -> **$7,500-10,000 (3% tax)**
      * $5,252-6,565 -> **$10,000-12,500 (3.50% tax)**
      * $6,565-7,878 -> **$12,500-15,000 (4% tax)**
      * $7,878-9,191 -> **$15,000-17,500 (4.50% tax)**
      * $9,191+ -> **$17,500+ (4.70% tax)**
   * This may not be a *conventional* tax cut per se, but it ultimately ends up reducing the tax burden for hundreds of thousands of working Missourians by spreading out the brackets to include more people without raising taxes a cent from where they stand now overall. This approach also works due to the fact that it would go towards the budgetary surplus that Missouri is currently at risk of losing. In short, this is a win-win. Working people get tax breaks, taxes aren't raised a cent from where they stand, and it ends up making more money than other methods would. This plan, in total, would see a general tax reduction for every single income bracket while generating an additional $420 million in yearly revenue.
* **Closing Tax Loopholes:** As Governor, another one of my top priorities would be to close tax loopholes. As of now, Missouri deals with the burden of many notable tax loopholes, especially the Carried Interest and LLC loopholes, both of which allow corporations and the wealthy to skimp out on paying their fair share. As Governor, one of my first actions would be to close as many tax loopholes as possible. A fairer Missouri is built upon a fairer tax code, and doing this would be one way to accomplish that.

# Welfare

* **Remove Junk Foods from SNAP Eligibility:** One of the main issues that I perceive SNAP has is the fact that it covers junk foods, which are actively unhealthy. This issue represents a microcosm of America's public health struggle in recent decades. In order to remove junk foods from SNAP eligibility, a state needs to obtain a waiver from USDA, and if granted, a state can update its requirements to change that. As Governor, I would obtain that waiver from the USDA, and would remove soda, soft drinks, candy, energy drinks, and fruit and vegetable drinks with less than 50% natural juice from being covered by SNAP. Poor and working Missourians deserve access to a good meal, and the current SNAP eligibility parameters aren't accomplishing that for them.

# Infrastructure and Rural Development

* **Rural Broadband Expansion:** Rural Missourians deserve connectivity with the rest of us, yet the career politicians in Jefferson City continue to ignore them and let them down. This is something that I hold near and dear, and it's one of the causes that I would champion the strongest as Governor. Missouri already has a decent amount of federal money for expansion, about $2 billion as part of the Infrastructure and Jobs Act, and as Governor, I would put these funds to use, significantly expanding broadband access throughout rural Missouri, with the goal of achieving universal broadband coverage by the end of my first term. One of the biggest overarching concepts of my platform is giving rural voters a leg up, and this would be one of the ways to do it.
* **Roads & Bridges Repair/Bipartisan Infrastructure Packages:**  The roads and bridges of Missouri are currently in dire straits. This not only creates unsafe conditions for driving but also makes travel harder, something that Jefferson City has neglected time and time again. As Governor, I would assemble a task force to locate sections of road and bridges that are in the worst condition, and I would repair those by signing a bipartisan infrastructure package totaling $150 million (paid for with the extra money made by budget-balancing measures), with the goal of creating safer roads and safer bridges overall.

# War on Corruption

* **Curb the Influence of Corporations and Lobbyists:** Corruption has been a significant problem in Missouri over the last decade, especially under the previous administration, which has not been honest or transparent with the people of Missouri. As Governor, I would place a 1-year waiting period for lobbyists to join the state government and for officials to lobby the state legislature. I would also ban state candidates and officeholders from accepting contributions or gifts during any legislative session, and this would include banning unlimited gifts from lobbyists to lawmakers and elected officials (including the Governor) while requiring gift and lobbying disclosure forms.
* **Creating a Nonpartisan Watchdog to Enforce Ethics Commission Laws:** As Governor, I would empower the Missouri Ethics Commission to hold state government accountable with the authority to audit, investigate, and penalize politicians who violate Missouri's ethics laws and campaign finance laws. The Ethics Commission would be a non-partisan body, as established by law, in order to ensure no conflicts of interest in the state government. This would also come with a requirement to make campaign finance reports publicly accessible and available online, with deadlines of every thirty days in an election year and quarterly in non-election years.
* **Restoring Integrity to the Governor's Office:** Curbing special interests and lobbyists is just one part of my plan, whereas dealing with the governor's office itself is a whole different battle. As Governor, I would establish a task force known as the *""Blue Ribbon Task Force""*, which would be comprised of a combination of governance and policy experts, along with private citizens. This task force would recommend to the Governor and State Legislature specific steps and actions to clean up the state government. I would also establish a new requirement for the Governor's office and all state agencies to keep records of all meetings with lobbyists, contractors, and companies lobbying the government for legislation that benefits them. Lastly, I would support legislation to prohibit firms seeking a license, permit, or non-competitive contract, and their agents, PACs, and employees, from contributing over $250 to political campaigns on or after the solicitation date and/or 12 months after the most recent award.

# Restoring Fairness to Elections

* **Delegating Redistricting to an Independent Redistricting Commission:** It's no secret that the current government in Jefferson City has consistently shown contempt for the will of Missouri's people, and this has been proven yet again with their recent gerrymander of the state to favor themselves, dividing Missourians and preventing their voices from being heard. This is blatantly wrong, and as Governor, I would move the power of redistricting from the state legislature to an independent and non-partisan redistricting commission, with the goal of drawing fair Congressional and state-level maps that ensure all Missourians have an equal voice in deciding who represents us.

# Better Housing for Better Communities

* **Cracking Down on Foreign Ownership of Single-Family Units:** One of the biggest burdens currently facing the housing market, not just in Missouri but nationwide, is the lack of supply. This has driven rent prices up while leaving many financially unstable, and this is something that needs to end. While my powers for this specific policy point would be more limited at a state level, that wouldn't stop me from trying my hardest, and as Governor, I would do as much as possible to crack down on foreign ownership of single-family units. I would sign an executive order that bans foreign parties from acquiring any real estate near military bases, critical infrastructure, or other sensitive locations. I would pass legislation restricting individuals and entities from adversarial countries (a category designated by the federal government) from purchasing real estate in Missouri. All of these things would relieve a significant amount of pressure on our housing market, and most importantly, would be enormously beneficial for the people of Missouri, who are currently crushed by nickel-and-dime taxation and high rent prices.
* **Infrastructure-for-Housing Program:** One of the biggest obstacles faced by the housing market, both in Missouri and across the nation, is the lack of supply. This has caused rent to increase, which in turn has led to less affordability and increased homelessness. As Governor, I would take a similar approach to Phil Scott of Vermont, and the first thing that I would do is to implement an infrastructure-for-housing financing program, officially called the Missouri Housing and Infrastructure Fund (MOHIF), with this agency allowing municipalities and private developers to apply for coverage for upfront infrastructure costs (sewers, sidewalks, utilities) necessary for new housing developments, with repayment via incremental property tax gains implemented in conjunction with that.
* **Housing Rehabilitation/Brownfield Development:** Missouri's housing market faces a similar problem to America's housing market, that not only being lack of supply, but also a lack of quality. Many housing units are degraded and falling apart, while unused land remains undeveloped. As Governor, I would establish a Missouri Housing Rehabilitation Fund (MOHRF), which would support owners of older rental housing to bring units up to health, safety, and energy standards, with support primarily targeted towards moderate-income buyers, or the ""missing middle"" of home ownership. I would provide tax incentives for the conversion of under-utilized and blighted units as well. In addition to this, I would expand development tools for Missouri's brownfields by providing state grants and loans for remediation and conversion to residential housing. I would also direct local land bank entities to acquire abandoned, foreclosed, and neglected properties and promote affordable housing development there. I believe that if we want to increase supply, we first need to rebuild it where it exists on paper. This approach is not only cost-efficient but would likely increase housing supply significantly within the first half of my administration.

# Common-Sense Gun Laws

* **Protecting Missouri's 2nd Amendment Rights:** Missouri, as it stands, is a bastion of Second Amendment rights in a nation with increasingly restrictive gun laws. I'm a strongly pro-2A Democrat, and I will stand in the way of any efforts to crack down on the constitutional rights of Missourians. Missouri's crime rate is low and continuously getting lower, partially due to our gun policy, which has been successful. As Governor, I would protect the Second Amendment rights of all Missourians and would stand directly in the way of any attempt at federal overreach. Of course, some limited compromise on the most bare-bones common-sense rules might be prudent, but as they stand, Missouri's gun laws are adequate, and I have no intention of altering them.
* **Strengthen Gun Show Protection Laws:** As Governor, I would commit to passing the *Gun Show Freedom Act*, which would affirm the legality of private firearms sales at gun shows without interference, and relax the venue restrictions or zoning bans on gun shows placed by local municipalities, while limiting some of the civil liability for vendors in lawful gun show transactions. The goal would be to remove unnecessary red tape and affirm the rights of gun owners while ensuring that common-sense guardrails exist, such as in the previous prong of my plan with universal background checks. Missouri's crime rates are already relatively low, so I don't foresee this becoming a major issue.

# Healthcare

* **Protection and Expansion of Medicaid:** Missouri is one of the states that faces the biggest hurdles with healthcare policy, and that includes Medicaid. Medicaid is under threat from our current leaders, and as Governor, I would do everything in my power to not only protect it but also to expand it. This is why I would sign legislation that expands benefits to include dental, vision, and behavioral healthcare, while also extending postpartum Medicaid benefits to 10 months. In addition, I would also expand Medicaid access to 200,000 Missourians by increasing state funding for Medicaid and the ACA by $75 million per year. No Missourian deserves the burden of crushing healthcare prices at every turn, which is why I would expand Medicaid to give all Missourians fair healthcare prices and adequate coverage. However, there would be strong oversight involved in this spending, and I'm just as against wasteful spending as the next Democrat or Republican, and I would ensure that we don't fall into the slippery slope of wasteful spending. But when looking at the larger picture, giving working Missourians a leg up will never be wasteful.
* **Increasing Funding for Rural Hospitals:** Missouri's rural hospitals are in a deep struggle as it stands. In just the last year, several rural hospitals have closed, meaning that receiving adequate healthcare treatment has been made harder for millions across rural Missouri. The government in Jefferson City has failed rural voters by failing to invest in our rural communities and our rural healthcare, and that needs to change. As Governor, I would create a program known as the *Rural Hospital Rescue Program,* which would distribute $225 million annually across the state to all struggling hospitals, with the goal of not only restoring the operational integrity of these hospitals but also building new ones, especially in rural areas. Rural Missouri deserves healthcare as much as Urban Missouri does, and I would want to make that happen as Governor. I would also aim to construct 5 new hospitals in underserved areas across the state. We need equitable healthcare in Missouri, and giving the citizens of our rural areas a leg up will be the first step in accomplishing that.
* **Capping Insulin & Drug Prices:** Pharmaceutical prices have been out of control, with Big Pharma showing complete disregard for the well-being of the citizens of this country, and most importantly, the citizens of Missouri. As Governor, I would work to pass a $50 per. 30-day supply cap on insulin copayments. Every Missourian deserves to have healthcare prices that they can afford, and reducing the financial burden that Big Pharma has placed on Missourians will be the first step in accomplishing that. I would also expand the scope of this to other essential medications, the next ones being epinephrine auto-injectors and asthma inhalers, both of which I would cap at $35 and $50 for monthly out-of-pocket costs, respectively. Common-sense healthcare reforms like this are how we can achieve a healthier and more just Missouri, and as Governor, I would proudly champion these causes.
* **Creating a Missouri Prescription Drug Affordability Board (PDAB):** For those who don't know, a Prescription Drug Affordability Board (PDAB) is a state-level entity that reviews and manages the affordability of prescription drugs, with the ultimate goal of making drugs and pharmaceuticals more affordable while balancing the healthcare budget of the state in which it is implemented. For Missouri, this would be no different. Both red and blue states have established PDABs, and anyone in Jefferson City with half a brain should know that this would be immensely beneficial for the working families of Missouri. As Governor, I would sign legislation intended to establish a Missouri Prescription Drug Affordability Board (Officially known as MOPDAB). The MOPDAB would review prescription drug prices and spending patterns, establish upper payment limits for certain drugs, and negotiate lower drug prices with drug companies. Missourians deserve fair prices and fair healthcare outcomes, and taking on the big drug companies that jack up costs for medications will be paramount to overcoming that hurdle.
* **10-Week Abortion Ban:** I'm personally pro-life. I believe that life begins at conception and that abortion is, for all intents and purposes, murder. However, I have a more nuanced view in practice, and I believe that a woman should have access to a safe abortion if she faces a health crisis or has had her body violated. I believe that Amendment 3 in particular is too lenient on abortion, allowing it up to the 24th week. As Governor, I would sign a 10-week abortion ban with exceptions for rape, incest, or the life of the mother, as a means of preventing late-term abortions. Abortion is a complicated and sensitive subject, but I believe that with reasonable compromise and pragmatic steps towards reducing the number of abortions, the results will be far better.

# Pro-Small Business Governance

* **Appointing a State Mom and Pop Czar:** Small businesses are the backbone of not just Missouri's economy, but America's economy, and the career politicians in Jefferson City have shown that they don't give a damn about small business owners. Some regulations are prudent, but you shouldn't have to get 50 permits and go through 10 agencies to start a barbershop. As Governor, I would appoint a Mom and Pop Czar, a high-level official who would act as the voice and problem solver for small and independently run businesses. The Mom and Pop Czar would offer regulatory advice to the Governor and legislature, along with reviewing regulations to identify rules negatively impacting small businesses, publishing annual reports on figures such as business start times, how long permits take, etc., helps coordinate with other agencies to fast-track permit times and to consolidate approvals so small business owners won't have to go across multiple agencies to get approved for health codes, zoning, etc. The Mom and Pop Czar would also sit on the governor's cabinet, and would be an advocate for small business interests in any major economic decisions, while also handling and reporting systemic bottlenecks, and coordinating with other agencies to speed up turnaround times while providing new and existing small businesses with assistance for getting through the mountains of permits and legal regulations that do exist.
* **Cut Fines and Fees for Small Businesses by 35%:** Missouri's small businesses are not only crushed by an overly bureaucratic system of regulations, but are also peppered with fines and fees as they grow and incorporate more into their businesses. As Governor, I would take executive action to slash the following fines and fees by 35% total: Startup & licensing fees, renewal fees, late or noncompliance fees, inspection and compliance fees, and miscellaneous ""nuisance"" fees. Reducing these fees collectively and by a substantial amount would do wonders for Missouri's small businesses and would significantly reduce the financial burden that many face. Every small business and small business owner deserves better, and I would deliver on this if elected.
* **Expanding Tax Credits for Mom and Pop Businesses:** The biggest hurdle in being a small business owner is the process of actually starting a business and getting off the ground. The bureaucratic aspect of this is one thing, but the lack of opportunity is another. As Governor, I wouldn't just reduce the burden for small businesses, but I would also give them a leg up. Firstly, I would expand job creation and hiring credits. Right now, the tax credit given for small businesses (legally designated as a business employing less than 25 people) sits between $1,000-2,000 per new job created. I would expand this credit to $4,000 per new job created. I would also take executive action to exempt small businesses from state business income taxes for the first year after creation, along with a flat and refundable $5,000 credit. Lastly, I would offer a 12.5% state match for firms with under 25 employees that provide healthcare coverage. Small businesses deserve better than the malaise that has plagued Jefferson City for decades, and as Governor, I would seek to eliminate it.

# A Balanced Budget for a Balanced Government

* **Balancing the State Budget:** Missouri is currently running a budgetary surplus, which is good, but that budgetary surplus is rapidly dwindling. Jefferson City has routinely engaged in wasteful spending and unnecessary cuts that have caused our budget to dwindle from a strong surplus under Jay Nixon to a weak and shrinking surplus under our current government. As Governor, balancing the state budget and strengthening our surplus would be one of my top priorities, and there are several ways I plan on doing it. The first course of action would be to aggressively close tax loopholes, which have been a significant thorn in the side of all state governments and even the national government. On day one, I would assemble a task force dedicated to finding loopholes in Missouri's tax code, after which I would close the tax loopholes. This could do wonders for Missouri's increasingly tight financial situation without harming Missourians. I would also assemble a task force that would identify bloat in government services and would recommend to the Governor what bloat to cut. Unlike what has been done in other states, I would not cut services, but slashing bloat and unnecessary spending would be a high priority. By slashing unnecessary spending and cutting out bloat without touching the services that give everyday Missourians a leg up, hundreds of millions in wasteful government spending would now be available to invest in Missourians. Lastly, and perhaps most controversially, I would raise Missouri's cigarette tax from 0.17% to 0.73%, a move which could generate up to $400 million in additional revenue, revenue that could pay down the financial sums for some of my other policies and that could go towards rebuilding Missouri's budgetary surplus. All of these actions, combined, could generate nearly $1 billion in additional annual revenue for the state government, more than enough to not only finance the government services that help Missourians but to strengthen the budgetary surplus that Missouri is at risk of losing, and as Governor, I would proudly champion any effort to rebuild our surplus.

# Energy

* **Reopening All Intrastate Oil and Natural Gas Pipelines:** This isn't a particularly large problem that Missouri deals with, at least not in comparison to other states, but it is something worth talking about. Gas prices in Missouri currently sit at $2.75 per gallon, which is a bit too high for the comfort of both me and many Missourians. This can be partially attributed to the fact that there have been several major closures of local gas pipelines due to leakages, and while temporary closures are warranted for those fixes, these closures have been long and arduous, with most not even addressing the safety issues that existed to begin with. As Governor, I would fully fund efforts to repair and increase the safety of all broken/non-functional local gas pipelines in the state of Missouri, after which I would open them back up for full service, which would likely see at least some measurable effect on gas prices. Missourians deserve lower prices, and this would be one of the many ways to deliver on that.
* **Redistributing Climate Funds to Bolster Nuclear Energy:** Missouri currently receives a variety of climate and environmental funding from the federal government, amounting to around $300 million per year total. These funds, as a whole, tend to go towards renewable and green transportation projects. While I don't believe that these are *bad* investments, I do believe that there are better uses for our climate funds. As Governor, I would shift a large portion of Missouri's yearly climate funding towards nuclear energy and the construction of nuclear power plants. Firstly, nuclear energy is a safe and sustainable source of energy; scientific consensus has concluded this time and time again. Secondly, it would create thousands of jobs for Missourians, and many more than the standard eco-friendly banners of solar and wind would create. This reinvestment has the opportunity to significantly expand Missouri's industry while offering thousands of working Missourians a good-paying job, all while reducing our carbon emissions and keeping the economy afloat.

# Pro-Worker, Pro-Union, Pro-Missouri

* **Re-Ratifying Prop A Measures for Paid Sick Leave:** In 2024, Missouri voters approved Prop A, which was a ballot measure that would raise the minimum wage, and most importantly, would require all employers to provide one hour of paid sick leave for every thirty hours worked, by fifteen percentage points, in a state that voted for President Trump by nearly twenty percentage points. However, earlier this year, the state legislature repealed it, yet another example of the political establishment in Jefferson City turning its back on working Missourians. The current Governor was paramount in the success of repeal efforts, despite many common-sense Republicans in the State House and Senate opposing the repeal. This is disastrous for the working people of Missouri, and I believe that we must work to reinstate sick leave requirements for working families, which I would champion through legislation as Governor. The working people of Missouri deserve better than what we have now.
* **Raising the Minimum Wage to $15:** An increase in the minimum wage was another part of Prop A that ended up on the chopping block in the State House earlier this year. While it was ultimately spared, the minimum wage in Missouri currently sits at $13.75, which is lower than the planned increase to $15/hr in January of 2026, something that the current government is already trying to sabotage. As Governor, I would prevent any efforts to further undermine Prop A and the provisions it established, while safeguarding the planned increase to $15/hr next year. Every Missourian deserves a fair shake and a fair opportunity to get ahead, and establishing a fair minimum wage will largely contribute to that aspiration.

# Protecting Missouri Farmers

* **Banning the Sale of Missouri Farmland to Foreign Companies:** One problem that isn't talked about enough is the fact that foreign companies, especially Chinese foreign companies, have been quietly buying up Missouri's farmland. This is completely unfair to our farmers, who are already struggling with corporate buyouts, and it's saddening to see that the current government has done nothing to stop it. As Governor, I would take executive action to fully ban foreign companies from buying up Missouri farmland. Missouri farmland should be farmer-owned and farmer-operated.
* **Fair System Reform Act:** Corporate and factory farming has taken a toll on the farming industry nationwide, especially in a state like Missouri, where farming is one of the largest industries. The practices of corporate farming are blatantly unfair to the family farmers who work hard to not only feed us and our families but also to sustain their own. The burden on them is already heavy, and stringent corporate farming practices exacerbate that. As Governor, I would sign the Fair System Reform Act into law, which would expand tax credits to family farmers while cutting property taxes on family/individually-owned farms by 10% and increasing oversight/transparency requirements on existing factory farms within the state, such as repealing ""ag-gag"" laws that conceal abuse within the factory farm industries while taking stronger anti-trust action against factory farms by actively outlawing megamergers at the state level to prevent consolidation of competition. Missouri farmers deserve a fair shake, yet the government in Jefferson City hasn't done anything about it. As Governor, I would make sure to change that.
* **""Made in Missouri"" Labeling Requirements:** Broadly, one of my biggest priorities is to give Missouri farmers a leg up, especially when taking into consideration the unfair hand they've been dealt in recent decades. One of the ways to do this is by increasing public awareness of farmer/locally-made products. As Governor, I would sign legislation that requires all products made in Missouri and by an individual or family farm to have labels stating ""Made in Missouri"" clearly on the products. While it may be small, a policy like this could increase revenue for many struggling family and individual farmers, and is just one of the many ways I plan on helping farmers if elected.
* **Expanding Tax Credits for Family and Individual Farmers:** It's no secret that working Missourians have been crushed by nickel-and-dime taxation for decades, but farmers have been hit particularly hard by this, as they not only have to deal with that, but also a lack of opportunity and incentive to keep them going, especially with the increase of corporate and factory farms. As Governor, I would expand the following tax credits by around 2.5-5% to cover thousands more family and individual farmers, as all of them aid those aforementioned groups:
   * Family Farm Breeding Livestock tax Credit
   * Agricultural Products Utilization Contributor Tax Credit
   * Farm to Food Donation Tax Credit
   * Beginning Farmer Tax Deduction Program
* **Food for Dignity Initiative:** Missouri farmers put in a backbreaking amount of work to feed us every day, and streamlining that effort through a small but effective program will be one way to further assist them. As Governor, I would begin a program known as the Food for Dignity Initiative, in which the state government would buy surplus crops and livestock from farmers at fair market prices, with those surplus crops and livestock being sold to vetted food banks and charities around Missouri. This would be a win-win, as farmers not only make a bit of extra money, but hungry individuals get access to higher-quality food products. The Food for Dignity Initiative would likely be of significant help to both groups, and I would proudly champion it as Governor.

# Education

* **Raising Teacher Pay to Competitive Levels:** As it stands, Missouri has one of the worst teacher retention rates in the entire United States, and it's largely thanks to the fact that we don't pay them adequately. We rank 49th in the nation for teacher salaries, which not only harms our teachers but also our schools. Missouri currently has one of the lowest minimum teacher salaries in the entire Midwest, sitting at around $38,900/year. As Governor, I would raise the minimum teacher salary to $42,500 to match roughly the median of the rest of the Midwest, not as high as states like Illinois, but better off compared to many other states. Our educators and teachers devote their time and their lives to giving our kids a quality education, and it's time that we pay them what they deserve.
* **Phasing Out DEI and Affirmative Action Initiatives:** One of my deepest-held personal convictions is that of meritocracy. Where one gets ahead in society on his own merits and abilities. For this reason, I'm against DEI and affirmative action initiatives, as they essentially set racial or ethnic quotas for positions when they should be judged on merit and merit alone. As Governor, I would make an effort to phase DEI and Affirmative Action initiatives out of the state education curriculum and procedures. DEI is harmful in practice, and as Governor, I will move our education system away from it.
* **School Choice Within the Public System:** One of the most prominent debates on the topic of education is school choice. In principle, school choice isn't something that I'm completely against, but I'm also against efforts to defund our public schools. As a product of public schools, they have provided millions with quality education, and I don't want to take that away. However, I do believe that compromises can be made. As Governor, I would support initiatives to allow for school choice within the public school system, allowing parents freedom of choice for their children without defunding public schools.
* **Free School Lunches and Breakfasts for Schoolchildren:** Free school lunches and breakfasts have already made a political splash elsewhere, most notably in Minnesota, where it has seen success in reducing child hunger. A policy like this in Missouri could be extremely beneficial, and it is my firm belief that children should never go hungry. As Governor, I would sign and pass legislation that would make school lunches and breakfasts free for all children in Pre-K, elementary school, middle school, and high school. This would be a crucial step to support our children, and I would be proud to sponsor it if elected.

# Reaching Across the Aisle

* **The Common Sense Coalition:** As Governor, I would be fully committed to working with Democrats, Republicans, and Independents to get things done. I would form a coalition of Democrats and Republicans in both the State House and the State Senate, known as the ""Common Sense Coalition"", with the collective goal of sweeping aside the partisan bluster of Jefferson City and working together for solutions that will improve the lives of all Missourians. Every Missourian deserves a functional government, and I'm committed to delivering on that.
* **Working with President Trump to Bring Federal Dollars to Missouri:** One of the most disappointing things in modern politics is that neither side can compromise and work together. In the case of many governors across the United States, this is especially potent, as it's quite commonplace to refuse to work with the President, which is what many Democrats in blue states have done with Donald Trump. However, I'm different from them. Whether we like it or not, Donald Trump is our president, and I refuse to hold the people of Missouri hostage just because my personal feelings might be different. Missourians deserve a proactive Governor that brings home the bacon, and as Governor, I would make it one of my main priorities to do so, through working with the current administration. I won't suck up to anyone or bend the knee to anyone, that's something that I adamantly refuse to do, and that goes for both those in my party and opposite in political affiliation to me. But we deserve better than the partisan gridlock that we've been subjected to for the past decade, and as Governor, I will make it my mission to break that gridlock.
* **Bipartisan Cabinet:** This is a smaller one, but I also think it's important in my broader agenda of reaching across the aisle. If elected Governor, I would ensure that my cabinet consists of a mix of Democrats, Independents, and Republicans, with help from advisors and certain legislators on the best choices to pick. The best decisions come from a variety of viewpoints, and organizing my cabinet in this way would deliver on that.

# Conclusion

That's about it for my gubernatorial platform. I tried to write this in a style that's less like gigantic policy paragraphs and more like if I were actually running a campaign and had to write my platform for a website, or something along those lines. This took far longer than I expected initially, so I apologize. I initially planned to add an electoral strategy to the post, but because it ended up making it too long, I'll leave it in the comments instead.

-----

Based on the transcript you provided from the Class Unity YouTube channel, here is a detailed summary of the discussion with Dr. Christopher Mott. The conversation covers his analysis of contemporary U.S. foreign policy, the concept of ""woke imperium,"" the shift towards a multipolar world, and the potential long-term consequences of the war in Ukraine.

### 🎙️ Speaker and Core Thesis

The guest is **Dr. Christopher Mott**, a research fellow at the Institute for Peace and Diplomacy. His central argument is that U.S. foreign policy often uses the language and aesthetics of domestic social issues to build public support for interventionist and hegemonic objectives. He terms this phenomenon **""woke imperium.""**

-   **A Recurring Tactic, Not a New Ideology**: Dr. Mott stresses that using cultural issues to sell foreign policy is not new. He draws parallels to Victorian imperialism, Woodrow Wilson's progressive paternalism, and the Bush administration's use of evangelical rhetoric. The ""woke"" variant is simply the latest incarnation, tailored to appeal to a professional, managerial class.
-   **Bipartisan Support for Hegemony**: He argues that despite surface-level differences, the foreign policy establishment—including both ""neoconservatives"" and ""liberal internationalists""—ultimately supports the same core policies of massive defense spending, global military presence, and interventionism. The different cultural justifications (e.g., human rights vs. raw power) primarily serve to rally different domestic political bases.

### 🗺️ Multipolarity and the ""Polycentrism"" of Civilizational States

A major theme of the discussion is the decline of American unipolar dominance and the rise of a **multipolar**—or as Dr. Mott prefers, **""polycentric""**—world order.

-   **End of an Era**: The post-Cold War era of U.S. hegemony is seen as temporary and is now ending. This shift demands a new foreign policy approach that the U.S. establishment is psychologically and institutionally unprepared for.
-   **The Resilience of ""Civilizational States""**: Dr. Mott introduces the concept of ""civilizational states""—countries with deep historical and cultural roots, such as Iran, Russia, and China. He argues that their core geopolitical interests (e.g., securing their borders, dominating their near abroad) are rooted in geography and history and are unlikely to change, regardless of their internal government or ideology. Therefore, attempts at regime change are often futile, as a new government would likely pursue similar strategic goals.
-   **A More Pragmatic World**: In this polycentric system, Dr. Mott suggests that countries with less security and wealth (smaller or more vulnerable nations) cannot afford to be ideological in their foreign policy and must be pragmatic. Great powers, however, often succumb to the ""luxury"" of missionary ideology, which he views as dangerous and destabilizing.

### ⚔️ Analysis of Specific Conflicts and Regions

The conversation applied these theoretical frameworks to several ongoing conflicts:

-   **Ukraine and Russia**:
    -   Dr. Mott characterizes Russia as a regional power asserting itself in its ""near abroad,"" an action he finds predictable from a realist perspective, even if he disagrees with its methods or its turn toward a ""conservative civilizational"" ideology.
    -   He is critical of European powers, particularly Germany and the Baltics, for what he perceives as aggressive and unrealistic rhetoric, enabled by the U.S. security umbrella. He notes the irony of, for example, the German Green Party adopting hawkish, pro-interventionist positions.
    -   **A Central Warning: The ""Mujahideen"" Parallel**: A significant part of the discussion focused on a potential long-term consequence of the war. Dr. Mott speculates that when the war ends, likely with an outcome unfavorable to Ukraine, the well-armed, battle-hardened, and potentially disillusioned nationalist factions (he mentions the Azov Battalion) could become a major problem. He draws a direct parallel to the U.S. arming of the Afghan Mujahideen in the 1980s, who later formed the Taliban and Al-Qaeda. His concern is that these Ukrainian groups, suffering from ""fry corp syndrome"" (a likely reference to ""freikorps"" or paramilitary groups), could turn their anger elsewhere, potentially creating a future terrorist or mafia network that could threaten Europe.

-   **China**: He views China as a remarkably pragmatic superpower that has so far resisted the temptation to cloak its foreign policy in universalist ideology, focusing instead on its core interests. He notes a recent, tentative pullback in U.S. belligerence toward China, suggesting a potential for a more restrained rivalry.

-   **Venezuela and Iran**:
    -   He interprets the Trump administration's focus on Venezuela as primarily driven by a desire to control its vast oil resources, with anti-socialist rhetoric being a ""packaging"" for domestic consumption.
    -   Regarding Iran, he reiterates that its role as a regional counterbalance is a function of its geography and history, and that any future government—secular or otherwise—would likely maintain a similar strategic posture, potentially even more effectively.

### 💡 Advice for Different Political Camps

Dr. Mott concludes with advice rooted in his realist philosophy:

-   **For the Left**: He urges leftists to abandon the idea of a ""right side of history"" or a progressive, teleological view of history. He advocates for a focus on medium-term planning, improving living standards in the present, and recognizing that international politics is an endless, morally gray struggle without a utopian endpoint.
-   **For U.S. Foreign Policy Elites**: The necessary but unlikely ""strategic cultural shift"" would involve accepting that the U.S. is no longer the world's sole moral arbiter, learning to negotiate with countries that have different value systems, and redefining the national interest to benefit the average citizen rather than defense contractors and other special interests.

### ❓ Q&A Highlights

The Q&A session delved deeper into:

-   **The Role of Class in Geopolitics**: Dr. Mott agreed that classical realism often overlooks how domestic class interests (e.g., those of wealthy asset owners and defense contractors) shape what is defined as the ""national interest."" He aligns more with ""neoclassical realism,"" which incorporates domestic politics into the analysis of international relations.
-   **The Psychology of the Foreign Policy Establishment**: He described a significant portion of the D.C. policy milieu as ""true believers"" in America's role as an ""indispensable nation,"" influenced by a culture of shows like *The West Wing*, which glorifies a moralistic approach to power.

In summary, the discussion presents a critique of U.S. foreign policy as being driven by a hegemonic impulse, sold to the public through evolving cultural narratives, and dangerously ill-adapted for a multipolar world. Its most striking warning is that the West's support for Ukrainian forces risks creating a powerful blowback, similar to the unintended consequences of the Mujahideen alliance in the 1980s.",RandomCollection,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn9rS5g7OaA,1,2025-11-04

What she did not disclose, and Drop Site News (@ryangrim
 and @esaagar) uncovered, is that in 2024 the U.S. spent $18 million funding Venezuelan opposition groups, including covering Nobel laureate María Corina Machado’s global travel, as part of a broader $213 million campaign over five years bankrolling anti-Maduro organizations through USAID.

In fact, after formally disbanding USAID in Feb 2025, the Trump administration has quietly rerouted $400 million to operations against left-leaning governments in Venezuela, Cuba, and Nicaragua.

------

When asked about her relationship with U.S. Senator Marco Rubio, opposition leader Machado says he’s among the people in Washington who “best understand the threats posed from our region.”

“I have been in touch with him, of course — and with his team.”

Gold Market Update — Tuesday

Price Action: Spot gold slipped 0.4% to $3,984.49 per ounce, while U.S. gold futures declined 0.5% to $3,994.40 in early trading.

Key Driver: A strong U.S. dollar, hovering near a three-month high, weighed on bullion as traders scaled back expectations for a Federal Reserve rate cut in December.

Market Sentiment: “The firm dollar and easing rate-cut expectations are putting pressure on gold,” said Tim Waterer, Chief Market Analyst at KCM Trade.

Fed Outlook: The Fed has already cut rates twice in 2025, but Chair Jerome Powell emphasized that further easing is “not a foregone conclusion.”

Rate-Cut Odds: According to the CME FedWatch Tool, markets now see a 65% probability of a December rate cut — down from over 90% before Powell’s remarks.

Data Watch: Traders are eyeing the ADP employment report and ISM manufacturing data this week for fresh policy cues.

Analyst View: A weaker-than-expected ADP print could help gold regain momentum.

Performance: Despite the recent pullback, gold remains up 53% year-to-date, though still 8% below its record high reached on October 20.

Global Context: Easing U.S.-China tensions, following President Donald Trump’s decision to trim tariffs, further diminished gold’s safe-haven appeal.
